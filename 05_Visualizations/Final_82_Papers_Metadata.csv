Insider threats represent a major cybersecurity challenge for private and public organizations, as an insider attack can cause extensive damage to organization assets much more than external attacks. Most existing approaches in the field of insider threat focused on detecting general insider attack scenarios. However, insider attacks can be carried out in different ways, and the most dangerous one is a data leakage attack that can be executed by a malicious insider before his/her leaving an organization. This paper proposes a machine learning‐based model for detecting such serious insider threat incidents. The proposed model addresses the possible bias of detection results that can occur due to an inappropriate encoding process by employing the feature scaling and one‐hot encoding techniques. Furthermore, the imbalance issue of the utilized dataset is also addressed utilizing the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE). Well known machine learning algorithms are employed to detect the most accurate classifier that can detect data leakage events executed by malicious insiders during the sensitive period before they leave an organization. We provide a proof of concept for our model by applying it on CMU‐CERT Insider Threat Dataset and comparing its performance with the ground truth. The experimental results show that our model detects insider data leakage events with an AUC‐ROC value of 0.99, outperforming the existing approaches that are validated on the same dataset. The proposed model provides effective methods to address possible bias and class imbalance issues for the aim of devising an effective insider data leakage detection system. © 2021 by the authors.

In the process of traditional reactive forensic investigation, analysis and interpretation of the digital evidence are performed after a crime has been committed. Even if insiders can be detected, they have already caused huge damage. In this paper, we propose a novel general unsupervised anomaly detection scheme based on cascaded autoencoders (CAEs) and joint optimization network. Our core idea is to utilize CAEs to do data purification among unlabeled digital evidence, then jointly optimize the dimension reduction and density estimation network to avoid sub-optimal problems. Based on this scheme, we design an end-to-end insider threat prediction framework for proactive forensic investigation, through which we can make real time response to prevent the harmful influences of insider threats in advance. We extract the tractable and scalable feature representation automatically through the data driven Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) feature extractor, waiving the time-consuming and customarily expert dependable feature engineering work. Additionally, a hypergraph correction module is applied to solve the commonly existed relatively high false positive rate problem in insider threat detection. We evaluate our scheme and framework on public benchmark datasets. The empirical experiments demonstrate that our models outperform state-of-the-art unsupervised methods. © 2021 The Authors",2021,23/12/2025 2:34,27/12/2025 5:33,,,,,38,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,<p>Export Date: 23 December 2025; Cited By: 23</p>,C:\Users\rao\Zotero\storage\9AAIFUKV\Wei et al. - 2021 - Insider threat prediction based on unsupervised anomaly detection scheme for proactive forensic inve.pdf; C:\Users\rao\Zotero\storage\8Y3M93AJ\Wei et al. - 2021 - Insider threat prediction based on unsupervised anomaly detection scheme for proactive forensic inve.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The existing state-of-the-art solutions, extensively rely on human decision making and correlation-based analysis, to understand the anomalous intent of an insider. This consequently leads to data breaches, hence making insider threats one of the biggest challenges faced by the cybersecurity community today. To deal with these issues, new access control architectures and models must focus on the integration of threat analytics, auto-resiliency, and fast response time to mitigate an ongoing threat in a timely manner. In this article, to address these issues and limitations, we propose an integrated access control policy regulation framework, designed on biological principles. The proposed framework provides the ground to efficiently integrate Threat Analytics with Policy Regulation Mechanism against insider threats. Another major contribution of this article is to model access control policy regulation mechanism as an auto-regulatory state transition system, which could autonomously change its state (policy configuration) in real-time against an emergent insider threat. As the last step, with the help of formal methods, we rigorously verify, evaluate, and test the performance of our proposed systems on a real-life threat test dataset.",1/4/2021,23/12/2025 4:17,27/12/2025 5:50,,412-425,,,117,,Future Generation Computer Systems,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,C:\Users\rao\Zotero\storage\N5KIJI8N\Rauf et al. - 2021 - Formal approach to thwart against insider attacks A bio-inspired auto-resilient policy regulation f.pdf,,Access control; Behavioral analysis; Bio-inspired design; Cyber threat intelligence; Formal verification; Insider threats; Policy regulation; Threat analytics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Insider threat detection involves many challenges, including unbalanced data, limited ground truth, and possible user behavior changes. This research presents an unsupervised learning based anomaly detection approach for insider threat detection. We employ four unsupervised learning methods with different working principles, and explore various representations of data with temporal information. Furthermore, different computational intelligence schemes are explored to combine these models to create anomaly detection ensembles for improving the detection performance. Evaluation results show that the approach allows learning from unlabelled data under challenging conditions for insider threat detection. Insider threats are detected with high detection and low false positive rates. For example, 60% of malicious insiders are detected under 0.1% investigation budget, and all malicious insiders are detected at less than 5% investigation budget. Furthermore, we explore the ability of the proposed approach to generalize for detecting new anomalous behaviors in different datasets, i.e., robustness. Finally, results demonstrate that a voting-based ensemble of anomaly detection can be used to improve detection performance as well as the robustness. Comparisons with the state-of-the-art confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach. © 2004-2012 IEEE.",2021,23/12/2025 2:34,27/12/2025 5:33,,1152-1164,,2,18,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,<p>Export Date: 23 December 2025; Cited By: 96</p>,C:\Users\rao\Zotero\storage\838K62V5\Le - 2021 - Anomaly Detection for Insider Threats Using Unsupervised Ensembles.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rogue employees who possess legitimate access to systems, and knowledge of security policies and monitoring practices of organizations, can evade detection. Organizations remain ill-equipped in detecting, deterring and mitigating sophisticated insider attacks, as traditional security controls and detection systems are tailored to external threats. Literature on insider threat detection provides the theoretical foundation to understand the motives, behavior and patterns of insider attacks. The majority of proposed models for insider threat anomaly detection, mainly focus on processing network data. In this paper, we propose and evaluate a Bayesian Network architecture that can consider behavioral aspects in tandem with network data. Our system utilizes machine learning to understand the structure of the data, inputs specially crafted features based on theoretical foundations of insider threat and enables analysts to consider behavioral features, if such data is available. We applied our system on CMU’s synthetic dataset and our results provide justified and informed decisions on selecting parameters for Bayesian Networks and suggest that such an approach is highly effective. All attacks in the dataset were identified, with a very low number of false positives. © 2021, Innovative Information Science and Technology Research Group.

However, the selection of the most appropriate ML classification model for insider threats detection remains a challenge. Despite the prominence of ML in the domain of insider threat detection, none of the previous works have utilized ML techniques for building a hybrid solution that can take advantage of the misuse and anomaly insider threat detection. In this study, a new multilayer framework has been proposed for insider threat detection. The first layer of the framework is used for selecting the best insider threat detection classification model among many based on the multi-criteria decision making techniques. The selection procedure has been developed based on the integration of the entropy-VIKOR methods. For the second layer, a hybrid insider threat detection method has been proposed, where the Misuse Insider Threat Detection (MITD) model has been created using the random forest algorithm. Subsequently, using the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm, an anomaly insider threat detection algorithm has been developed. The proposed multilayer framework for insider threat detection has been evaluated by using the CERT r4.2 dataset. Results of the experiment demonstrate that the validity of the results produced by the selection framework is proven by the validation procedure obtained from previous research. The proposed hybrid detection method is observed to exhibit an overall accuracy of 99% and a false positive rate of 0.29% for known insider threats, whereas it exhibits 97% accuracy and 2.88% false-positive rate for unknown insider threats. © 2021",2022,23/12/2025 2:34,27/12/2025 5:33,,,,,97,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,<p>Export Date: 23 December 2025; Cited By: 72</p>,C:\Users\rao\Zotero\storage\E2UGGS2U\Al-Mhiqani et al. - 2022 - A new intelligent multilayer framework for insider threat detection.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is as a result of the fact that they are frequently faced with internal and external threats that can put the data they have been entrusted with in jeopardy of being compromised. As a result of this, this study investigates the dimension of threats associated to unintentional internal user of an organisation and utilises NARX to model and test a detection scheme associated to the menace. In addition, this study aims to provide a better understanding of the current state of the threat landscape. The data adopted for this research is primarily a 'user activity logs' dataset from CERT (release version r4.2). From the data, the study conceptualized 'Access', 'Motivation', and 'Action' to be the key dimensions influencing 'insider', whereas 'Intent', '+Action', 'Method', and 'knowledge' are the key dimension influencing 'threats'. Experimental analyses conducted by NARX within several numbers of partitions of the data point to a good detection capacity, with the greatest value of R2 coming in at 0.97. This indicates that NARX was able to detect the crucial dimension that was formulated for by the research to be the detections parameter of an inadvertent insider threat when operating under the best partition. In light of these findings, organisations can use the proposed approach to assess their preparedness for Insider attacks. © 2013 IEEE.",2022,23/12/2025 2:34,27/12/2025 5:33,,110294-110308,,,10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,"<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>Duplicate</p> <p></p> </div>; <p>Export Date: 23 December 2025; Cited By: 4</p>",C:\Users\rao\Zotero\storage\DAT2PAP9\Hafizur Rahman et al. - 2022 - Threats From Unintentional Insiders An Assessment of an Organization's Readiness Using Machine Lear.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Current enterprise systems are vulnerable to social engineering attacks. In addition, existing detection methods are relatively ineffective. Therefore, we propose a double-layer detection framework based on deep learning technology. First, a phishing email detection model based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and extreme gradient boosting tree (XGBoost) is designed from the perspective of individual security. Then, an insider threat detection model based on Bidirectional LSTM and Attention mechanism is designed from the perspective of group security. Finally, combined with the social engineering network attack simulation theory, a social engineering attack and defense simulation platform is established. In the double-layer frame-work, we use Bi-LSTM to obtain long-range dependent features of email body and user sequence information. Then XGBoost and Attention mechanism are used to further strengthen the network structure and improve the classification accuracy. Compared with traditional methods, our model does not require manual feature extraction, and can accurately identify phishing emails and insider threats. Finally, our proposed social engineering simulation platform verifies the effectiveness of the two-layer model. The experimental results show that our proposed framework has the characteristics of timely detection and after-the-fact investigation, which can effectively detect phishing attacks and insider threats faced by enterprise systems. © 1986-2012 IEEE.",2022,23/12/2025 2:34,27/12/2025 5:33,,92-98,,6,36,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,<p>Export Date: 23 December 2025; Cited By: 8</p>,C:\Users\rao\Zotero\storage\NNVPCIQF\He et al. - 2022 - An Effective Double-Layer Detection System Against Social Engineering Attacks.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent studies suggest that the cost of insider attacks is higher than the external threats, making it an essential aspect of information security for organizations. Efficient insider threat detection requires state-of-the-art Artificial Intelligence models and utility. Although significant have been made to detect insider threats for more than a decade, there are many limitations, including a lack of real data, low accuracy, and a relatively low false alarm, which are major concerns needing further investigation. In this paper, an attempt to fulfill these gaps by detecting insider threats with the novelties of the present investigation first developed two deep learning hybrid LSTM models integrated with Goo-gle's Word2vec LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) GLoVe (Global Vectors for Word Representation) LSTM. Secondly, the performance of two hybrid DL models was compared with the state-of-the-art ML models such as XGBoost, Ada-Boost, RF (Random Forest), KNN (K-Nearest Neighbor) and LR (Logistics Regression). Thirdly, the present investigation bridges the gaps of using a real dataset, high accuracy, and significantly lower false alarm rate. It was found that ML-based models outperformed the DL-based ones. The results were evaluated based on earlier studies and deemed efficient at detecting insider threats using the real dataset. © 2022, Tech Science Press.

Most existing solutions are not flexible and adaptable to detect sudden change in user's behaviour in streaming data, which led to a high false alarm rates and low detection rates. In this study, a model that is capable of adapting to the changing pattern in structured cyberspace data streams in order to detect malicious insider activities in cyberspace was proposed. The Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) dataset was used as the data source in this study. Extracted features from the dataset were normalized using Min-Max normalization. Standard scaler techniques and mutual information gain technique were used to determine the best features for classification. A hybrid detection model was formulated using the synergism of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) models. Model simulation was performed using python programming language. Performance evaluation was carried out by assessing and comparing the performance of the proposed model with a selected existing model using accuracy, precision and sensitivity as performance metrics. The result of the simulation showed that the developed model has an increase of 1.48% of detection accuracy, 4.21% of precision and 1.25% sensitivity over the existing model.

Adding a widely applicable security layer into existing ones in terms of verification can be achieved by profiling users by their behaviors. A great candidate may be mouse dynamics. The nature of behavioral biometry based on mouse dynamics contains less sensitive data and still can perform well enough. We present a verification model based on assigning legality scores to individual mouse actions and aggregate these scores to assign a legality probability to the whole session while investigating frequency domain features of movement sequences. How the combinational schemes can improve the performance of the overall system is also investigated. The publicly known Balabit Dataset which contains 10 users’ training and test sessions is used for evaluation. The classifiers are trained with only training sessions and evaluated on test sessions. After extensive several experiments, equal error rate with a value of 7.46% and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve with a value of 96.47% are achieved. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE.",2022,23/12/2025 2:34,27/12/2025 5:33,,239-251,,2,21,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,<p>Export Date: 23 December 2025; Cited By: 8</p>,C:\Users\rao\Zotero\storage\6GKQTDDF\Yıldırım and Anarım - 2022 - Mitigating insider threat by profiling users based on mouse usage pattern ensemble learning and fre.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Insider threats were malicious activities which are executed by an official worker within an institution. Insider threats indicate cybersecurity challenges for public and private companies, as an insider attack could cause widespread damages to company properties than exterior attacks. Many prevailing methods in the domain of insider threat concentrated on identifying general insider attack situations. But insider attacks are takes place in several ways, and one of the dangerous attack is a data leakage attack which is accomplished by a malicious insider before one leaves a company. This article develops a Metaheuristic with Weighted Fusion Based Insider Data Leakage Detection and Classification (MWF-IDLDC) Model for Ubiquitous Computing Systems. The presented MWF-IDLDC technique primarily performs pre-processing and feature extraction at the initial stage. In addition, the MWF-IDLDC technique derives a weighted fusion-based feature extraction approach comprising three DL methods namely long short-term memory (LSTM), gated recurrent unit (GRU), and stacked autoencoder (SAE). For optimally tuning the hyperparameters related to the DL models, the ant lion optimizer (ALO) algorithm is utilized in this study. The design of fusion process with ALO hyperparameter optimizer demonstrate the novelty of the work. The experimental validation of the MWF-IDLDC approach can be tested using a series of simulations and the outcomes were scrutinized under distinct aspects. The comparative analysis highlighted the improvements of the MWF-IDLDC method compared to recent approaches with maximum accuracy of 99.40%. © 2022",2022,23/12/2025 2:34,27/12/2025 5:33,,,,,54,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,<p>Export Date: 23 December 2025; Cited By: 8</p>,C:\Users\rao\Zotero\storage\DXRN4I3E\Alabdulkreem et al. - 2022 - Optimal weighted fusion based insider data leakage detection and classification model for Ubiquitous.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Even though the tremendous changes cloud computing has brought to the business world, its centralization makes it challenging to use distributed services like security systems. Valuable data breaches might occur due to the high volume of data that moves between businesses and cloud service suppliers, both accidental and malicious. The malicious insider becomes a crucial threat to the organization since they have more access and opportunity to produce significant damage. Unlike outsiders, insiders possess privileged and proper access to information and resources. In this work, a machine learning-based system for insider threat detection and classification is proposed and developed a systematic approach to identify various anomalous occurrences that may point to anomalies and security problems associated with privilege escalation. By combining many models, ensemble learning enhances machine learning outcomes and enables greater prediction performance. Multiple studies have been presented regarding detecting irregularities and vulnerabilities in network systems to find security flaws or threats involving privilege escalation. But these studies lack the proper identification of the attacks. This study proposes and evaluates ensembles of Machine learning (ML) techniques in this context. This paper implements machine learning algorithms for the classification of insider attacks. A customized dataset from multiple files of the CERT dataset is used. Four machine learning algorithms, i.e., Random Forest (RF), Adaboost, XGBoost, and LightGBM, are applied to that dataset and analyzed results. Overall, LightGBM performed best. However, some other algorithms, such as RF or AdaBoost, may perform better on some internal attacks (Behavioral Biometrics attacks) or other internal attacks. Therefore, there is room for incorporating more than one machine learning algorithm to obtain a stronger classification in multiple internal attacks. Among the proposed algorithms, the LightGBM algorithm provides the highest accuracy of 97%; the other accuracy values are RF at 86%, AdaBoost at 88%, and XGBoost at 88.27%. © 2013 IEEE.",2023,23/12/2025 2:34,27/12/2025 5:33,,46561-46576,,,11,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,<p>Export Date: 23 December 2025; Cited By: 43</p>,C:\Users\rao\Zotero\storage\592GB4JS\Mehmood et al. - 2023 - Privilege Escalation Attack Detection and Mitigation in Cloud Using Machine Learning.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The issue of insider threat detection for information systems has received many researchers' attention in both security and data mining fields, and a lot of related research results were presented. However, there are still many challenges in capturing the behavior difference between malicious insiders and normal users accurately, such as lack of labeled insider threats, the subtle and adaptive nature of insider threats, complexity, heterogeneity, sparsity of the underlying data, etc. To detect insider threats with large and complex audit data, a Multi-Edge Weight Relational Graph Neural Network method (MEWRGNN) for robust anomaly detection is proposed in this paper. Unlike most existing approaches, the MEWRGNN adopts several graph neural networks to capture the contextual relationship of user behaviors over a period of time, which is a critical factor for achieving accurate anomaly identification. The MEWRGNN achieves a certain degree of interpretability through ranking the contribution of different edge-representation features. Evaluation experimental results demonstrate that the MEWRGNN can learn a model from limited sample data sets, and achieve quick and accurate insider threat detection performance. In addition, other feature ranking results allow providing security analysts with understandable insights for investigating the detected insider threats. © 2004-2012 IEEE.",2023,23/12/2025 2:34,27/12/2025 5:33,,3717-3733,,3,20,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,<p>Export Date: 23 December 2025; Cited By: 21</p>,C:\Users\rao\Zotero\storage\RIB6VMJB\Xiao et al. - 2023 - Robust Anomaly-Based Insider Threat Detection Using Graph Neural Network.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since insider actions may only leave a small digital footprint in the system, it is considered a major cybersecurity challenge in different applications. Along with the rapid growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) and the extensive attack surface in this technology, many concerns have been raised regarding the potential insider threats in IoT environments. Several studies have been conducted on Machine Learning (ML)-based insider threat detection solutions which are focused on the models' performance while the trustability of these models is neglected. Trustworthy Learning refers to a new trend in ML that focuses on ways to ensure that the data collection and data analysis procedures in ML techniques follow ethical applications and are trustable to human users. This approach enforces the acceptance and successful adoption of ML-based solutions. This study aims to propose an improved trustworthy insider threat detection method that ensures two of the trustworthy learning requirements: Privacy and Explainability.

Concerning this problem, there has been a multitude of solutions, including the detection of sentiment fluctuations of an entity to predict its abnormality degree. Previous research solely focus on the analysis of individual anomalies, but ignore the sociality of individual sentiments. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an approach to internal threats detection based on sentiment and network analysis. Above all, we use Natural Language ToolKit (NLTK) to analyze the sentiment of each preprocessed email, and thus we establish sentiment communication network. The graphs are reconstructed into series and reshaped as matrices. By the singular value decomposition (SVD), the matrix is decomposed into base networks, and we analyze the change in importance of important base networks over time to detect the company’s internal conditions. When anomalies occur, we establish combination networks which consist of base networks and can represent the abnormal character patterns of this time. Then compare the eigenvector centrality of both combination networks and total network to identify the employees related to this anomaly. The experiment shows that it can locate the anomaly-related employees accurately, and according to the network graph, the top few of anomaly-related employees are associated in group internal threats.

Anomaly in electronic health record can be associated with an insider trying to access and manipulate the data. This article focuses around the anomalies under different contexts. Methodology: This research has proposed methodology to secure Electronic Health Records (EHRs) within a complex environment. We have employed a systematic approach encompassing data preprocessing, labeling, modeling, and evaluation. Anomalies are not labelled thus a mechanism is required that predicts them with greater accuracy and less false positive results. This research utilized unsupervised machine learning algorithms that includes Isolation Forest and Local Outlier Factor clustering algorithms. By calculating anomaly scores and validating clustering through metrics like the Silhouette Score and Dunn Score, we enhanced the capacity to secure sensitive healthcare data evolving digital threats. Three variations of Isolation Forest (IForest)models (SVM, Decision Tree, and Random Forest) and three variations of Local Outlier Factor (LOF) models (SVM, Decision Tree, and Random Forest) are evaluated based on accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F1 Score. Results: Isolation Forest SVM achieves the highest accuracy of 99.21%, high sensitivity (99.75%) and specificity (99.32%), and a commendable F1 Score of 98.72%. The Isolation Forest Decision Tree also performs well with an accuracy of 98.92% and an F1 Score of 99.35%. However, the Isolation Forest Random Forest exhibits lower specificity (72.84%) than the other models. Conclusion: The experimental results reveal that Isolation Forest SVM emerges as the top performer showcasing the effectiveness of these models in anomaly detection tasks. The proposed methodology utilizing isolation forest and SVM produced better results by detecting anomalies with less false positives in this specific EHR of a hospital in North England. Furthermore the proposal is also able to identify new contextual anomalies that were not identified in the baseline methodology. © The Author(s) 2024.",2024,23/12/2025 2:34,27/12/2025 5:33,,,,1,24,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,<p>Export Date: 23 December 2025; Cited By: 24</p>,C:\Users\rao\Zotero\storage\DEQFYS7E\Tabassum et al. - 2024 - Anomaly-based threat detection in smart health using machine learning.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These threats are rare and usually unnoticed, as the malicious actions are often submerged in numerous normal activities, causing dataset imbalance and making detection hard. To address these challenges, in this paper we propose a Two-Step Insider Threat Detection (TSITD) approach. First, it preprocesses the CERT r4.2 and r5.2 datasets into day-long sequences. Second, it handles the dataset imbalance and detects threats by forming various combinations of sampling techniques and classifiers, referred to as TSITD models. When we compare these TSITD models to baseline models, we observe a significant improvement in anomaly detection rate and balanced accuracy. The TSITD models also achieve higher rankings when evaluated using the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",2024,23/12/2025 2:34,27/12/2025 5:33,,,,,120,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,<p>Export Date: 23 December 2025; Cited By: 3</p>,C:\Users\rao\Zotero\storage\PCJ44TA9\Jaiswal et al. - 2024 - Handling imbalance dataset issue in insider threat detection using machine learning methods.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Within this sphere, insider threats represent a unique and particularly insidious class of security risks, originating not from external hackers but from within the organization itself. These threats are perpetrated by individuals with inside information concerning the organization's security practices, data, and computer systems. Traditional security measures like firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and antivirus software are often inadequate for tackling insider threats effectively, owing to their focus on external threats. This inadequacy underscores the urgent need for the development and implementation of more sophisticated, targeted detection techniques for insider threats. In response to this challenge, our research introduces an innovative approach that employs the Density-Based Local Outlier Factor (DBLOF) algorithm, fine-tuned to specifically tackle the challenges posed by the imbalanced nature of the CERT r4.2 insider threat dataset. This dataset is characterized by a highly skewed distribution, with a significant majority of benign instances and only a minimal proportion of malicious activities. Conventional detection algorithms often fail to effectively identify these rare but dangerous instances, leading to a high rate of false negatives. Our methodology capitalizes on the algorithm's ability to focus on the local density deviation of data points, thereby enabling the precise identification of outliers that are indicative of potential insider threats. Through rigorous testing and validation processes, we have achieved outstanding results, with an of F-score 98%. These remarkable outcomes not only affirm the effectiveness of the DBLOF algorithm as a powerful tool for combating insider threats but also contribute valuable insights to the broader academic and professional discourse on cybersecurity. Importantly, our findings have practical implications, offering organizations actionable recommendations for boosting their internal security mechanisms against the complex and evolving landscape of insider threats. © 2013 IEEE.",2024,23/12/2025 2:34,27/12/2025 5:33,,34820-34834,,,12,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,<p>Export Date: 23 December 2025; Cited By: 19</p>,C:\Users\rao\Zotero\storage\NP6EBR4E\Al-Shehari et al. - 2024 - Enhancing Insider Threat Detection in Imbalanced Cybersecurity Settings Using the Density-Based Loca.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most existing supervised learning based detection methods that rely on transforming user behavior into sequential data do not fully utilize structural information and require extensive labeled data. This reliance poses a challenge due to the scarcity of labeled data in real-world scenarios, leading to a few-shot learning situation. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Graph modularized-based Meta-learning Framework for Insider Threat Detection, named GMFITD. Specifically, GMFITD utilizes a structural reconstruction mechanism that combines a graph-based autoencoder with an attention mechanism to explore structural information and infer potential relationships between users. Additionally, we employ a graph prototype construction method coupling episodic meta-learning principle (MAML) to compute representative embeddings for few-shot learning scenarios. By leveraging MAML, the proposed method can capture prior knowledge of insider threat classification by training on similar few-shot learning tasks with few labeled samples. We further enhance the resilience of GMFITD to adversarial attacks through an edge importance estimation mechanism, which assigns higher weights to relevant edges. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed GMFITD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in insider threat detection, achieving higher accuracy with fewer labeled samples and resisting adversarial attacks.",2024,27/12/2025 2:52,12/1/2026 6:51,,7161-7175,,,19,,IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,C:\Users\rao\Zotero\storage\7586GALT\X.

One issue of particular concern is the insider threat. Insiders seek to use their privileges to undermine data confidentiality, validity, and availability. Any sabotage committed by someone within a company significantly harms the company’s integrity, credibility, and financial profits. Automated feature extraction methods face challenges when used to classify data due to their tendency sometimes to return inaccurate results, leading to overfitting. Furthermore, analyzing irregular data requires extensive manual feature detection. We propose an algorithm that represents an expert system that detects insiders and determines their risk level as well. After that, the decisive step will be to intersect the results obtained from a classification using multiple algorithms with those obtained from the internal detection algorithm using expert rules. This research uses several classification methods that can deal with this type of data to predict the status of insiders within a computer network. The main goal of this study is to improve the accuracy and efficiency of identifying insiders within a computer network. Model performance evaluation includes important parameters such as precision, recall, and F1 score. The highest classification accuracy is obtained at 0.99, and after combining these results with the results of the proposed algorithm, the accuracy is 100%. These results highlight the remarkable ability of these models to detect internal states accurately, providing encouraging possibilities for improving cyber security within a computer network. © © 2024 by the authors.

Insider threat detection is a crucial component of a comprehensive cybersecurity strategy. By identifying and mitigating risks from within the organization, businesses can better protect their assets, maintain trust, and ensure compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. This paper addresses the detection of insider threats using machine learning algorithms. A famous CERT dataset was used for the experiments. The collected dataset is largely imbalanced. The ML algorithms cannot perform well with imbalanced datasets. So, data imbalance can be resolved by using three over sampling techniques namely random oversample, smote, adasyn and three under sampling techniques namely random under sample, Cluster centroids and Edited Nearest Neighbors. Later, five ML algorithms namely Logistic Regression, Adaboost, Decision Tree, Random Forest and Naïve Bayes applied to the datasets generated through over sampling and under sampling techniques. To further increase the performance of the model, an ensemble learning is proposed along with principal component analysis. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed model surpassed the performance of existing models for insider threat detection. © Little Lion Scientific.",2024,23/12/2025 2:34,27/12/2025 5:33,,914-926,,3,102,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,<p>Export Date: 23 December 2025; Cited By: 4</p>,C:\Users\rao\Zotero\storage\YQMQ2N4S\Pennada et al. - 2024 - ENHANCED INSIDER THREAT DETECTION THROUGH MACHINE LEARNING APPROACH WITH IMBALANCED DATA RESOLUTION.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture together with multi-head attention mechanism is applied in this work to detect anomalous network behavior patterns.

Detection of insider threats faces challenges of imbalanced data distributions and difficulties in fine-grained detection. Specifically, anomalous users and anomalous behaviors take up a very small fraction of all insider behavior data, making precise detection of anomalous users challenging. Moreover, not all behaviors of anomalous users are anomalous, so it is difficult to detect their behaviors by standardizing with single rules or models. To address these challenges, this paper presents a novel approach for insider threat detection, leveraging machine learning techniques to conduct multi-granularity anomaly detection. We introduce the Multi-Granularity User Anomalous Behavior Detection (MG-UABD) system, which combines coarse-grained and fine-grained anomaly detection to improve the accuracy and effectiveness of detecting anomalous behaviors. The coarse-grained module screens all of the user activities to identify potential anomalies, while the fine-grained module focuses on specific anomalous users to refine the detection process. Besides, MG-UABD employs a combination of oversampling and undersampling techniques to address the imbalance in the datasets, ensuring robust model performance. Through extensive experimentation on the commonly used dataset CERT R4.2, we demonstrate that the MG-UABD system achieves superior detection rate and precision. Compared to the suboptimal model, the accuracy has increased by 3.1% and the detection rate has increased by 4.1%. Our findings suggest that a multi-granularity approach for anomaly detection, combined with tailored sampling strategies, is highly effective in addressing insider threats. © 2024 by the authors.",2025,23/12/2025 2:34,27/12/2025 5:33,,,,1,15,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,<p>Export Date: 23 December 2025; Cited By: 0</p>,C:\Users\rao\Zotero\storage\P24UXTWP\Feng et al. - 2025 - Multi-Granularity User Anomalous Behavior Detection.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this work, we propose a deep learning-based user authentication framework that combines keystroke dynamics with Siamese neural networks to differentiate legitimate users from impostors. A key challenge in this area is the variability in password lengths, which leads to different feature sizes and complicates model training. Our approach uses interpolation-based data fusion strategies to standardize the number of keystroke features, ensuring consistency across different datasets and password lengths. Through experiments on the fused CMU and KeyRecs datasets, we have evaluated the effectiveness of the proposed decision-making framework with adaptive threshold strategies. The threshold strategy determines how the final decision boundary is set with respect to the user's baseline typing behavior. We empirically evaluated the framework on fused data, achieving an equal error rate as low as 0.11–0.12, indicating strong efficacy in detecting insider threats. We show how the obtained Siamese neural network with triplet loss function can be used to distinguish genuine users from impostors even under different input conditions, contributing to more robust and scalable intrusion detection systems. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd",2025,23/12/2025 2:34,27/12/2025 5:33,,,,,155,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,<p>Export Date: 23 December 2025; Cited By: 3</p>,C:\Users\rao\Zotero\storage\J2EMRVV4\Medvedev et al. - 2025 - A decision-making framework for user authentication using keystroke dynamics.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These attacks, including Advanced Persistent Threats (APT), Pivoting, and Lateral Movement, often involve prolonged timelines and similar sensitive actions. Given the complexity of these attacks, current internal threat detection methods have their shortcomings. Firstly, internal threat attacks typically involve multiple sequences of malicious operations, making it challenging to capture the entire attack process using a single model. Secondly, current research often overlooks the interconnections between user behavior sequences, failing to differentiate between malicious intentions, actions, and outcomes. This neglect may lead to forensic inaccuracies and the misattribution of benign activities as attacks, potentially causing erroneous responses. Furthermore, existing internal threat detection methods fail to mine relevant attack evidence from known sensitive behaviors to thoroughly analyze the attack mechanisms. To address these challenges, we propose Ripple2Detect, a multi-step evidence detection framework for insider threat detection. First, Ripple2Detect builds an evidence sequence library by decomposing known attack behaviors into sequences and constructing a knowledge graph to measure their correlations. Next, we train a semantic similarity model based on the BERT architecture, tailored for operation sequences, to improve the detection of attack evidence. To overcome data imbalance, we introduce a contrastive learning loss to better distinguish between attack and non-attack behaviors. Finally, a preference propagation mechanism is used to predict attack behaviors within the knowledge graph. We conduct experiments on Cert-r4.2 and Cert-r5.2 benchmark datasets, comparing our model with state-of-the-art approaches. The results suggest that our model can identify malicious sequences with 0.96 F1 score and achieve an attack identification F1 score of up to 0.99.

However, conventional access controls are static and fail to consider evolving user activities and contextual threats, leading to internal risks and breaches. This research proposes an AI-driven, autonomous, identity-based threat segmentation framework for ZTA. Behavioral analytics provide real-time risk scores by analyzing login patterns, access behavior, and resource utilization, while Machine Learning models dynamically adjust permissions based on geolocation, device type, and time of access. Automated threat segmentation enables the real-time isolation of compromised identities, minimizing breach progression. Practical use cases, such as insider threat mitigation across distributed offices, are discussed. Privacy concerns, false positives, and scalability challenges are addressed.

Traditional methods mainly analyze user behavior patterns or convert behaviors into time sequences for further analysis. However, existing detection methods primarily focus on identifying abnormal users or behaviors, lacking the capability to pinpoint specific threats. Additionally, these methods struggle to accurately identify long-distance dependencies in behavior sequences, frequently increasing false positives. To address these issues, we introduce a scenario-oriented insider threat detection model. This model targets three specific threat scenarios-privilege abuse, identity theft, and data leakage-by analyzing user behavior patterns, extracting detailed behavioral characteristics, and constructing behavior sequences. Firstly, this paper serializes user behavior daily and vectorizes it using one-hot encoding. Then, it introduces contextual characteristic information and reconstructs the background of abnormal behavior through behavior vectorization, providing a comprehensive description of user behavior characteristics. This approach addresses the issue of behavior isolation, thereby improving the accuracy and robustness of anomaly detection. Subsequently, a time series analysis model based on a multi-head attention mechanism is employed to analyze long-distance dependencies in behavior sequences. The multi-head attention mechanism simultaneously attends to multiple positions in the behavior sequence, capturing potential correlations between behaviors and user behavior patterns. This mechanism can analyze local information and obtain long-distance dependencies, providing depth feature representation for anomaly detection. Ultimately, we achieve the goal of classifying abnormal behavior sequences. We conduct comprehensive tests on the CERT dataset, demonstrating that our method outperforms traditional deep learning approaches (LSTM, GNN, and GCN) in detecting abnormal sequences. Compared to the best results among the baseline methods, it shows an improvement in accuracy of approximately 2% for privilege abuse, 5% for identity theft, and 2% for data leakage.",9/3/2025,27/12/2025 4:33,27/12/2025 5:33,27/12/2025 4:33,17,,1,8,,Cybersecurity,,,,,,,,en,,,,,DOI.org (Crossref),,,,C:\Users\rao\Zotero\storage\FMZ7KJF6\Tian et al. - 2025 - Insider threat detection for specific threat scenarios.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An adversary can improve the stealth and effectiveness of such attacks by utilizing XAI techniques, which makes the detection of such attacks more difficult. The study uses publicly available datasets to evaluate the robustness of the deep learning models in this situation.

Given the extensive attack surface, system assets continuously face cyber security challenges, such as weak authentication, exploitation of system vulnerabilities, and malicious software. Through specific vulnerabilities, attackers may gain unauthorized system access, masquerading as legitimate users, and remaining hidden. Successful attacks can lead to the leakage of user privacy, disruption of business operations, significant financial losses, and damage to corporate reputation. The increasing complexity of attack vectors is blurring the boundaries between insider and external threats. To address this issue, this article introduces the IDU-Detector, an innovative threat detection framework that strategically integrates intrusion detection systems (IDSs) with user and entity behavior analytics (UEBA). This integration aims to monitor unauthorized access and malicious attacks within systems, bridging functional gaps between existing systems, ensuring continuous monitoring and real-time response of the network environment, and enhancing their collective effectiveness in identifying security threats. Additionally, the existing insider threat datasets exhibit significant deficiencies in both depth and comprehensiveness, lacking sufficient coverage of diverse attack vectors. This limitation hinders the ability of insider threat detection technologies to effectively address the growing complexity and expanding scope of sophisticated attack surfaces. To address these gaps, we propose new, more enriched and diverse datasets that includes a wider range of attack scenarios, thereby enhancing the adaptability and effectiveness of detection technologies in complex threat environments. We tested our framework on different datasets, the IDU-Detector achieved average accuracy rates of 98.96% and 99.12%. These results demonstrate the method’s effectiveness in detecting masquerader attacks and other malicious activities, significantly improving security protection and incident response speed, and providing a higher level of security assurance for asset safety. © 2014 IEEE.",2025,23/12/2025 2:34,27/12/2025 5:33,,9653-9670,,8,12,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,<p>Export Date: 23 December 2025; Cited By: 0</p>,C:\Users\rao\Zotero\storage\Z4HREVUH\Huang et al. - 2025 - IDU-Detector A Synergistic Framework for Robust Masquerader Attack Detection.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The objective of this study is to implement deep learning models to boost organizational threat identification via human behavior assessment and continuous surveillance activities. Our method for human behavior analysis detects insider threats through assessments of user activities that include logon patterns along with device interactions and measurement of psychometric traits. CNN, together with Random Forest classifiers, has been utilized to identify behavioral patterns that indicate security threats from inside the organization. Our model uses labeled datasets of abnormal user behavior to properly differentiate between normal and dangerous user activities with high accuracy. The physical security component improves surveillance abilities through the use of MobileNetV2 for real-time anomaly detection in CCTV video data. The system receives training to detect security breaches and violent and unauthorized entry attempts, and specific security-related incidents. The combination of transfer learning and fine-tuning methodologies enables MobileNetV2 to deliver outstanding security anomaly detection alongside low power requirements, thus it fits into Security Operations Centers operations. Experiments using our framework operate on existing benchmark collection sets that assess cybersecurity, together with physical security threats. Experimental testing establishes high precision levels for detecting insider threats along with physical security violations by surpassing conventional rule-based methods.

These days, the user's internal risks have a significant impact on this cloud. An intrusive party is established as a network member and presented as a user. Once they have access to the network, they will attempt to attack or steal confidential information while others are exchanging information or conversing. For the cloud network's external security, there are numerous options. But it's important to deal with internal or insider threats. Thus, in the proposed work, an advanced deep learning with optimized missing value imputation is developed to mitigate insider thread in the cloud system. Behavioral log files were taken in an organization which is split into sequential data and standalone data based on the login process. This data was not ready for the detection process due to improper data samples so it was pre-processed using Multivariate Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE) imputation. In this imputation process, the estimation parameter was optimally chosen using the Golf Optimization Algorithm (GOA). After the missing values were filled, the data proceeded to the extraction process. In this, the sequential data are proceeded for the domain extractor and the standalone data are proceeded for Long Short-Term Memory-Autoencoder (LS-AE). Both features are fused to create a single data which is further given to the detection process using Jordan Neural Network (JNN). The proposed method offers 96% accuracy, 92% recall, 91.6% specificity, 8.39% fall out and 8% Miss Rate.

Although appropriate for detecting typical anomalies, conventional machine learning and deep learning models fail to detect the fine-grained and complex patterns typical of malicious insiders, especially on datasets with severe class imbalance. The author’s research validates the hybrid model with the CERT dataset containing this fault. For comparison, existing generative AI techniques like Deep Autoencoders (DAEs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) provide stronger anomaly detection based on latent feature extraction. However, they cannot capture specific vital behaviour patterns that enable proper threat identification. The paper presents a new hybrid method that can deal with these vulnerabilities. This approach combines the best traditional ML/DL methods synergistically with the generative power of DAEs and VAEs. The author's work builds a better feature space by fusing traditional behavioural patterns with latent features extracted from the generative model. This better feature space supports building a strong model that can perceive general and specific insider anomalies and activities, leading to much better detection performance. Experimental findings show that the author’s hybrid model outperforms isolation ML/DL and generative AI models considerably on important performance measures, achieving a 6.2% accuracy improvement, resulting in reduced false positives and enhanced detection accuracy in the event of sophisticated insider threat scenarios. These findings supplement the author’s earlier work, which investigated feature categorization and baseline ML/DL approaches on the CERT dataset, serving as a foundation for this hybrid approach, and demonstrate the advantage of combining generative AI with traditional machine learning towards improved performance in adverse environments. © 2025 Seventh Sense Research Group®.",2025,23/12/2025 2:34,27/12/2025 5:33,,102-113,,6,73,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,<p>Export Date: 23 December 2025; Cited By: 0</p>,C:\Users\rao\Zotero\storage\4XJ875XV\Pennada et al. - 2025 - Hybrid Machine Learning for Enhanced Insider Threat Detection Using Generative Latent Features.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While machine learning (ML) offers promise, the absence of a structured approach to prioritize and validate high-impact threat scenarios limits its practical adoption. This research addresses this gap by systematically identifying and validating the top 10 critical insider threat use cases—including data exfiltration, privilege escalation, and lateral movement—through a methodology combining MITRE ATT&CK tactics, Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR) statistics, and related research papers. We then integrate the Random Cut Forest (RCF) algorithm into the Wazuh/OpenSearch SIEM platform, tailoring its unsupervised learning capabilities to detect these prioritized threats in real time. By correlating ML-driven anomaly scores with rule-based alerts, our solution reduces false positives by 35% and achieves a 94% true positive rate for high-risk use cases like unauthorized access. Validation in a production environment confirms the framework’s efficacy, with detection times under 3 minutes for 80% of anomalies. Beyond technical integration, this work establishes a replicable blueprint for aligning ML models with operational priorities, empowering organizations to focus resources on the most damaging insider threats. © 2024 Authors.",2025,23/12/2025 2:34,27/12/2025 5:33,,272-293,,1,8,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,<p>Export Date: 23 December 2025; Cited By: 2</p>,C:\Users\rao\Zotero\storage\UGKV99V4\Ahmad - 2025 - Unveiling Anomalies Leveraging Machine Learning for Internal User Behaviour Analysis – Top 10 Use C.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Centralized methods for insider threat detection in IoT devices are critical for identifying and mitigating insider risks. User behavior, such as access patterns, login times and data transmission, is profiled using machine learning algorithms to detect deviations that may indicate insider risks. However, training a model that generalizes across different data sources is challenging due to data heterogeneity, which can lead to a drift in performance. This paper introduces a decentralized approach called federated learning (FL) to address these challenges. An advanced privacy-preserving method is proposed for detecting and reducing insider threats in IoT devices. The process begins with a trust authority generating a random digital certificate using the hybrid Rivest–Shamir–Adleman and elliptic curve digital signature algorithm for IoT user registration. Node clustering is performed using the ordering points to identify the clustering structure with centroid refinement algorithm, ensuring data privacy by transmitting only cluster heads to local models. Additionally, the federated automatic weight optimization hash-based message authentication code with secure hash algorithm is introduced to further strengthen protection. The experimental results show accuracy rates of 98.85% on the simulated dataset and 83.74% on the X-IIoTID test dataset. These finding facilitates the effectiveness of the proposed solution in terms of accuracy, time, throughput, node scalability and overall performance. The results indicate that the proposed model outperforms other prominent approaches in the field. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.",2025,23/12/2025 2:34,27/12/2025 5:33,,,,1,81,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,<p>Export Date: 23 December 2025; Cited By: 6</p>,C:\Users\rao\Zotero\storage\9866S3EI\Kamatchi and Uma - 2025 - Securing the edge privacy-preserving federated learning for insider threats in IoT networks.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Traditional intrusion detection systems struggle to differentiate between real and AI-generated activities, creating vulnerabilities in detecting malicious insiders. To address this challenge, this paper introduces a novel Deep Synthesis Insider Intrusion Detection (DS-IID) model. The model employs deep feature synthesis to automatically generate detailed user profiles from event data and utilizes binary deep learning for accurate threat identification. The DS-IID model addresses three key issues: it (i) detects malicious insiders using supervised learning, (ii) evaluates the effectiveness of generative algorithms in replicating real user profiles, and (iii) distinguishes between real and synthetic abnormal user profiles. To handle imbalanced data, the model uses on-the-fly weighted random sampling. Tested on the CERT insider threat dataset, the DS-IID achieved 97% accuracy and an AUC of 0.99. Moreover, the model demonstrates strong performance in differentiating real from AI-generated (synthetic) threats, achieving over 99% accuracy on optimally generated data. While primarily evaluated on synthetic datasets, the high accuracy of the DS-IID model suggests its potential as a valuable tool for real-world cybersecurity applications.",2/1/2025,22/12/2025 13:43,27/12/2025 5:33,,,,1,15,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:001389953300045,,,,,C:\Users\rao\Zotero\storage\N6C6DWEH\Kotb et al. - 2025 - A novel deep synthesis-based insider intrusion detection (DS-IID) model for malicious insiders and A.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Existing datasets used for training detection systems often lack realism, suffer from severe class imbalance, or are outdated. This paper presents a novel methodology for the generation of insider threat datasets through the integration of three data sources: (1) real user behavior collected during a controlled cyber exercise, (2) simulated user activity modeled on realistic work roles, and (3) synthetic data derived from the CERT Insider Threat Test dataset. The result is the SPEDIA dataset, designed to support the development and evaluation of machine learning models for detecting insider threats. The dataset includes detailed event-level logs of user activity, such as file manipulation, command execution, service usage, and network behavior, with annotations mapped to MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques. Unlike previous datasets, SPEDIA achieves a more balanced distribution of malicious and non-malicious events, enhancing its suitability for supervised learning. This work also provides a replicable framework for generating similar datasets, contributing to the advancement of insider threat detection research and the development of robust, real-world mitigation strategies. © 2025 The Author(s)",2026,23/12/2025 2:34,27/12/2025 5:33,,,,,161,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,<p>Export Date: 23 December 2025; Cited By: 0</p>,C:\Users\rao\Zotero\storage\Q7WZ9V4Z\Pérez-Miguel et al. - 2026 - Design and generation of a dataset for training insider threat prevention and detection models The.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
