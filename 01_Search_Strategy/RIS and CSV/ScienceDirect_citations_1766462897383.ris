AB  - The widespread usage of Android-powered devices in the Internet of Things (IoT) makes them susceptible to evolving cybersecurity threats. Most healthcare devices in IoT networks, such as smart watches, smart thermometers, biosensors, and more, are powered by the Android operating system, where preserving the privacy of user-sensitive data is of utmost importance. Detecting Android malware is thus vital for protecting sensitive information and ensuring the reliability of IoT networks. This article focuses on AI-enabled Android malware detection for improving zero trust security in IoT networks, which requires Android applications to be verified and authenticated before providing access to network resources. The zero trust security model requires strict identity verification for every entity trying to access resources on a private network, regardless of whether they are inside or outside the network perimeter. Our proposed solution, DP-RFECV-FNN, an innovative approach to Android malware detection that employs Differential Privacy (DP) within a Feedforward Neural Network (FNN) designed for IoT networks under the zero trust model. By integrating DP, we ensure the confidentiality of data during the detection process, setting a new standard for privacy in cybersecurity solutions. By combining the strengths of DP and zero trust security with the powerful learning capacity of the FNN, DP-RFECV-FNN demonstrates the ability to identify both known and novel malware types and achieves higher accuracy while maintaining strict privacy controls compared with recent papers. DP-RFECV-FNN achieves an accuracy ranging from 97.78% to 99.21% while utilizing static features and 93.49% to 94.36% for dynamic features of Android applications to detect whether it is malware or benign. These results are achieved under varying privacy budgets, ranging from ϵ=0.1 to ϵ=1.0. Furthermore, our proposed feature selection pipeline enables us to outperform the state-of-the-art by significantly reducing the number of selected features and training time while improving accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to categorize Android malware based on both static and dynamic features through a privacy-preserving neural network model.

AB  - SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) systems are critical for managing industrial processes, including energy production, manufacturing, and transportation. However, their reliance on protocols such as Modbus, which lack inherent security features, exposes them to sophisticated cyber threats. This paper explores vulnerabilities in the Modbus protocol to design advanced SCADA-specific attack scenarios—SCADA Hijacking and SCADA Blackout. These covert attacks exploit protocol weaknesses to manipulate process parameters or halt operations while evading detection by intrusion detection systems (IDS) and human operators, representing a significant escalation in the sophistication of cyber threats. To counter these threats, we propose a novel machine learning-based defense mechanism that incorporates heterogeneous graph embeddings, combining multimodal network data such as flow-level and packet-level features. The proposed attacks and defense mechanism were rigorously evaluated using precision, recall, F1 score, accuracy and false positive rate as key metrics, demonstrating the stealthiness of the attacks and the robustness of the defense. By exposing critical vulnerabilities and presenting an advanced intrusion detection framework, this research establishes a foundation for strengthening SCADA systems against evolving cyber threats, ensuring the security and reliability of industrial control systems.

AB  - The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) has transformed healthcare by enabling seamless communication among medical devices, supporting real-time monitoring, diagnostics, vital patient data tracking, improved patient care, disease prediction, early warning, and enhanced operational efficiency. Due to the sensitive nature of health-related data, the adoption of IoMT has raised significant privacy and security concerns, prompting comprehensive evaluation of IoMT security and making it a prime target for cyberattacks such as ransomware, denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, and malware. Securing IoMT requires efficient data processing across distributed systems to ensure both confidentiality and availability. Parallel and distributed computing can address scalability and performance challenges in IoMT security, particularly in enabling real-time monitoring and threat detection across multiple interconnected devices. This survey conducts a systematic literature review (SLR) of IoMT security to analyze key issues, categorize security threats, attack vectors, and vulnerabilities, and examine how emerging technologies such as blockchain, machine learning (ML), and physically unclonable functions (PUF) are strengthening IoMT security. This SLR reviews IoMT security research published between 2020 and 2024 to identify challenges and provide insights for future researchers and developers of new IoMT security models. This SLR offers practitioners and researchers guidance for developing reliable and resilient IoMT security systems in the decentralized healthcare industry.

AB  - Advanced cyber-attacks against critical infrastructure and the energy sector are becoming more common. With the invention of autonomous control systems (ACS) within advanced nuclear reactor designs, system designers, reactor operators, and regulators must consider cybersecurity during the design and operational phases. This article provides a cyber threat assessment of machine learning (ML)-based digital twinning (DT) technologies in the context of advanced reactor ACS. A cyber–physical testbed was created to emulate nuclear reactor digital instrumentation and controls (I&C) and act as a basis for the ACS. The ACS was designed as two plant-level DTs predicting reactor malfunctions and determining control actions and two component-level DTs responsible for classifying component states and forecasting component inputs and outputs (I/O). Two duplicate ACS designs– one using a traditional ML framework and one using an automated ML (AutoML) framework– were created and tested against cyber-attacks on training data, real-time process data, and ML model architectures to determine their respective qualitative cyber-risk in terms of likelihood and impact. Both frameworks showed similar cyber-resilience against training, real-time, and ML architecture attacks, proving that neither is inherently more secure. Recommended safeguard and security measures are posed to system designers, reactor operators, and regulators to maintain the cybersecurity of ML-based DT technologies such as ACS, prompting a holistic view of shared responsibility for maintaining cyber-secure ML-based systems.

In this article, we present our recent systematic and comprehensive survey on the state-of-the-art ML robustness and trustworthiness from a security engineering perspective, focusing on the problems in system threat analysis, design and evaluation faced in developing practical machine learning applications, in terms of robustness and user trust. Accordingly, we organize the presentation of this survey intended to facilitate the convey of the body of knowledge from this angle. We then describe a metamodel we created that represents the body of knowledge in a standard and visualized way. We further illustrate how to leverage the metamodel to guide a systematic threat analysis and security design process which extends and scales up the classic process. Finally, we propose the future research directions motivated by our findings. Our work differs itself from the existing surveys by (i) exploring the fundamental principles and best practices to support robust and trustworthy ML system development, and (ii) studying the interplay of robustness and user trust in the context of ML systems. We expect this survey provides a big picture for machine learning security practitioners.

AB  - Image generation techniques, such as generative adversarial networks (GANs), have become sufficiently sophisticated to cause growing concerns around the authenticity of images in the public domain. Although these generation techniques have been applied to a wide range of images, including images with objects and faces, there are comparatively few studies focused on their application to the generation and subsequent evaluation of Earth Observation (EO) data, such as aerial and satellite imagery. We examine the current state of aerial image generation by training state-of-the-art unconditional GAN models to generate realistic aerial imagery. We train PGGAN, StyleGAN2 and CoCoGAN models using the Inria Aerial Image benchmark dataset, and quantitatively assess the images they produce according to the Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) and the Kernel Inception Distance (KID). In a paired image human detection study we find that current synthesised EO images are capable of fooling humans and current performance metrics are limited in their ability to quantify the perceived visual quality of these images.

AB  - Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) enhances network efficiency by decentralizing resources closer to users, but it also introduces significant cybersecurity challenges, such as DDoS attacks, unauthorized access and data breaches. The effects of these potent attacks negate the principles of digital sovereignty. Securing MEC is crucial not only for system efficiency but also for ensuring digital sovereignty by safeguarding critical infrastructures and sensitive data from external entities. Nations and industries must safeguard sensitive data, defend against these evolving threats, and retain autonomous control over their digital ecosystem. In this study, considering various applicability of ML-based models, blockchain, and encryption techniques as cybersecurity strategies to combat cyber physical threats within MEC environments, it offers a systematic review of recent strategies from studies with 3 years. Although these methods are promising, scalability and practical applicability are hard to come by, especially in resource constrained settings. Our findings can help to develop secure, resilient MEC systems which can protect digital infrastructures, ensuring privacy, autonomy, and trust which are essential to maintaining digital sovereignty. This work offers valuable insights for future research to develop adaptable and robust solutions that ensure secure, decentralized systems, reinforcing the principles of digital sovereignty.

AB  - Sixth generation (6G) internet of things (IoT) networks will modernize the applications and satisfy user demands through implementing smart and automated systems. Intelligence-based infrastructure, also called reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs), have been introduced as a potential technology striving to improve system performance in terms of data rate, latency, reliability, availability, and connectivity. A huge amount of cost-effective passive components are included in RISs to interact with the impinging electromagnetic waves in a smart way. However, there are still some challenges in RIS system, such as finding the optimal configurations for a large number of RIS components. In this paper, we first provide a complete outline of the advancement of RISs along with machine learning (ML) algorithms and overview the working regulations as well as spectrum allocation in intelligent IoT systems. Also, we discuss the integration of different ML techniques in the context of RIS, including deep reinforcement learning (DRL), federated learning (FL), and FL-deep deterministic policy gradient (FL-DDPG) techniques which are utilized to design the radio propagation atmosphere without using pilot signals or channel state information (CSI). Additionally, in dynamic intelligent IoT networks, the application of existing integrated ML solutions to technical issues like user movement and random variations of wireless channels are surveyed. Finally, we present the main challenges and future directions in integrating RISs and other prominent methods to be applied in upcoming IoT networks.

AB  - Recently, Software Defined Networking (SDN) has emerged as the key technology in programming and orchestrating security policy in the security operations centers (SOCs) for heterogeneous networks. Typically, machine learning-based intrusion detection systems (ML-IDS) have been deployed and associated with SDN to leverage the features of a programmable network to defend against sophisticated cyberattacks in anomaly detection. Unfortunately, such ML-based IDSs are easily vulnerable to adversarial attacks due to the lack of diverse forms of malicious records in the training dataset. The missing data sample in the training phase can lead to a lower detection rate in real-world scenarios with adversarial settings. In this paper, we explore the ability of Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Networks with Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP), WGAN-GP with two timescale update rule (WGAN-GP TTUR), and AdvGAN in generating perturbed attack samples to bypass attack detectors. Then, this approach is used to continuously evaluate the robustness of ML-based IDSs and then upgrade them as a service in SDN. The experimental results on CICIDS2018 and InSDN datasets demonstrate that generated adversarial samples can be used to fool targeted IDS. Later, those created samples can supplement the original ones in retraining IDS to improve the resilience of the attack detector.

AB  - Backdoor attacks mislead machine-learning models to output an attacker-specified class when presented a specific trigger at test time. These attacks require poisoning the training data to compromise the learning algorithm, e.g., by injecting poisoning samples containing the trigger into the training set, along with the desired class label. Despite the increasing number of studies on backdoor attacks and defenses, the underlying factors affecting the success of backdoor attacks, along with their impact on the learning algorithm, are not yet well understood. In this work, we aim to shed light on this issue by unveiling that backdoor attacks induce a smoother decision function around the triggered samples – a phenomenon which we refer to as backdoor smoothing. To quantify backdoor smoothing, we define a measure that evaluates the uncertainty associated to the predictions of a classifier around the input samples. Our experiments show that smoothness increases when the trigger is added to the input samples, and that this phenomenon is more pronounced for more successful attacks. We also provide preliminary evidence that backdoor triggers are not the only smoothing-inducing patterns, but that also other artificial patterns can be detected by our approach, paving the way towards understanding the limitations of current defenses and designing novel ones.

AB  - Connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) are becoming increasingly common, and their popularity is expected to increase further, especially due to the ease and convenience they provide. An important component of CAVs is the Electronic Control Unit or the ECU; these ECUs are connected to each other through the Controller Area Network or CAN bus. The increasing use of CAVs has significantly expanded its threat landscape with several security vulnerabilities that can be severely damaging, especially when the ECUs or CAN are compromised. Existing security mechanisms are largely designed for known vulnerabilities, leaving the potential for unknown attacks high. In order to address this gap in detecting previously unknown attacks, we propose a novel autoencoder and payload fragmentation-based in-vehicle unknown intrusion method. For the precise prediction of attack and sub-attack, the data payload is fragmented into one-byte fragments, and the prediction dependency is analyzed for each fragment. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our proposed method shows improved performance with an attack classification accuracy of 99.88% and sub-attack accuracy of 99.98%.

AB  - By incorporating artificial intelligence into applications, everyone in the current circumstance has become intelligent, thereby reducing the burden of incessant interruption or human control. In today’s environment, most of the hardware infrastructure in buildings is connected to the internet, transforming the building infrastructure into a smart building infrastructure. In a similar vein, it should be noted that intelligent building infrastructure is susceptible to cyber-induced defects, and the issue of data privacy is a significant worry within the realm of collaborative learning. The primary objective of this study is to devise and implement an Attentive Interpretable Tabular-based Federated Learning methodology for safeguarding data privacy while detecting cyber-induced problems in the infrastructure of intelligent buildings. In this paper, Federated Learning ecosystem–based deep learning models are used to find and describe cyber-induced faults and vulnerabilities. The suggested system will be evaluated using various measures, including accuracy, precision, recall, and losses. In addition, the built ecosystem is examined using various data distributions to determine whether the outcomes are stable.

AB  - The multivariate Gaussian distribution underpins myriad operations-research, decision-analytic, and machine-learning models (e.g., Bayesian optimization, Gaussian influence diagrams, and variational autoencoders). However, despite recent advances in adversarial machine learning (AML), inference for Gaussian models in the presence of an adversary is notably understudied. Therefore, we consider a self-interested attacker who wishes to disrupt a decisionmaker’s conditional inference and subsequent actions by corrupting a set of evidentiary variables. To avoid detection, the attacker also desires the attack to appear plausible wherein plausibility is determined by the density of the corrupted evidence. We consider white- and grey-box settings such that the attacker has complete and incomplete knowledge about the decisionmaker’s underlying multivariate Gaussian distribution, respectively. Select instances are shown to reduce to quadratic and stochastic quadratic programs, and structural properties are derived to inform solution methods. We assess the impact and efficacy of these attacks in three examples, including, a real estate evaluation application, an interest rate prediction task, and the use of linear Gaussian state space models. Each example leverages an alternative underlying model, thereby highlighting the attacks’ broad applicability. Through these applications, we also juxtapose the behavior of the white- and grey-box attacks to understand how uncertainty and structure affect attacker behavior.

AB  - With insider attacks becoming more common and costing organizations more every year, it has never been more crucial to be able to predict when an insider attack may happen. Network Anomaly Detection Systems (NADS) have the ability to identify unusual behavior making them useful in predicting cyberattacks, but often suffer from high false positive rates. Honeypots used in conjunction with NADS can help with learning attack behaviors and enable better prediction. However both honeypots and legacy NADS are generally deployed at the gateway to a network. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework called Honeyboost, deployed in the LAN, rather than at the perimeter, focusing on internal-LAN traffic to predict, for example, a malicious insider attack. Honeyboost incorporates an NADS, as well as a honeypot, within an internal network. The anomaly detection technique incorporated into Honeyboost is Lookout, a new method built on extreme value theory that makes it possible to achieve highly desirable low false positive rates. Using data from the LAN Security Monitoring Project, Honeyboost identifies most anomalous nodes before they access the honeypot, thus aiding early detection and prediction. Honeyboost is an unsupervised method comprising of two approaches: horizontal and vertical. The horizontal approach constructs a time series from the communications, via ARP, TCP or UDP, of each node, with node-level features encapsulating the node’s behavior over time. The vertical approach finds anomalies in each protocol (ARP, TCP, UDP) space. Using a window-based model, typical in online scenarios, the horizontal and vertical approaches are combined to identify anomalies and gain useful insights. Experimental results indicate the efficacy of our framework in identifying suspicious activities of nodes.

AB  - Concrete privacy endeavours to give Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA) measures to secure traffic streams in sensitive healthcare applications are a necessity. When talking about the access of sensitive healthcare data or the confidentiality of highly esteemed data, the first thing that comes to mind is that it should be secured. Sensitive healthcare data needs to be protected to restrict illegal access, exposure, and/or manipulation. As there is no such protection by which we can make our systems fully secure, the most acceptable methodology is to perform layered modelling of safety measures. This paper intends to provide a mathematical description of the Modular Encryption Standard (MES) and the augmentation of condition-centric risk monitoring of confidential information to provide a layered model for securing healthcare data confidentiality. Decision-making regarding the risk monitoring strategy of MES is augmented using a machine learning approach based on a Fuzzy Inference System amalgamated with Neural Networks. Result analysis shows that MES has less than a 0.005 error-rate and a 97% precision-rate, which elucidates its desideratum towards increasing security risks.

AB  - The rise of advanced cyber threats targeting critical system recovery mechanisms necessitates proactive and scalable threat-hunting solutions. This research introduces a novel methodology leveraging a Linux-based Elasticsearch server to detect adversary techniques that inhibit system recovery (T1490). By integrating Elasticsearch for centralized log storage, Kibana for dynamic visualization, and Lucene for precise query search, the proposed platform offers a cost-effective and adaptable alternative to proprietary SIEM solutions. The methodology emphasizes real-time identification of indicators of compromise (IOCs) such as shadow copy deletions, suspicious commands, and backup configuration modifications, enabling security teams to uncover adversarial behaviors before they disrupt recovery processes. Practical implementation demonstrates the platform's flexibility across diverse IT environments, accommodating logs from endpoints with varying operating systems and infrastructures. The study further highlights the adaptability of the approach, with Kibana dashboards and Lucene queries tailored to specific organizational needs, making it a versatile tool for enterprises. Additionally, the research underscores the significance of proactive detection by moving beyond traditional reactive methods, positioning organizations to address system recovery threats effectively. This work bridges a critical gap in cybersecurity by offering a scalable, open-source threat-hunting platform that aligns with the growing need for robust defenses against evolving adversary techniques. The findings hold practical significance for enhancing incident response strategies and bolstering organizational resilience, paving the way for future integration with advanced threat intelligence feeds and automated detection mechanisms. This novel approach not only strengthens the security landscape but also provides a blueprint for cost-efficient, real-world applications in defending against adversary techniques designed to inhibit system recovery.

AB  - This paper provides a thorough examination of the most appropriate legal basis under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for personal data processing by essential and important entities while taking cybersecurity risk management measures as stipulated by the NIS 2 Directive such as using insider-threat detection technologies. It examines the feasibility of consent, legal obligation, public interest, and legitimate interest under Article 6 of the GDPR as possible legal grounds for data processing. It argues that consent under Article 6(1)(a) of and public interest under Article 6(1)(e) of the GDPR are not the most appropriate ones. Given the limits of consent and public interest as possible legal grounds, the focus of the analysis turns to legal obligation and legitimate interest as more appropriate legal grounds for processing personal data for cybersecurity risk management measures by essential and important entities. It assesses the appropriateness of those two bases for the processing of non-special categories of personal data, special categories of personal data and solely automated decision-making respectively. It argues that legal obligation under Article 6(1)(c) of the GDPR as a legal basis for cybersecurity is a missed opportunity under the NIS 2 Directive. The NIS 2 Directive does not meet the standards for establishing a legal obligation as a legal basis for personal data processing although it acknowledges the necessity of such processing. This argument is based on that it fails to clearly define the scope of personal data processing. This failure not only challenges the implementation of the Directive but also poses risks to private and family life (Article 7) and the right to data protection (Article 8) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.

AB  - The increasing demand for the Internet of Things (IoT) and various distributed devices has highlighted the need for reliable and effective intrusion detection systems to safeguard physical devices and data from cyber threats. However, managing large volumes of data with diverse dimensions and security features poses significant challenges, including reduced recognition accuracy, increased computational time, a large number of false positives, and overfitting issues. Integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) into intrusion detection systems has recently gained attention to enable intelligent recognition and protection against cyber threats. This research introduces a novel architecture called Automated Separate Guided Attention Federated Graph Neural Network (ASGAFGNN) for predicting and detecting cyberattacks. Initially, cyberattack data is gathered and pre-processed to enhance its quality. The pre-processed data then undergoes feature extraction to obtain global, local, and temporal features using a hybrid vision transformer with bidirectional long short-term memory. The extracted features are further processed using Batched Sparse Principal Component Analysis (BSPCA) and Intuitionistic Fuzzy C-Means (IFCM) for feature reduction. Finally, ASGAFGNN is deployed to detect and categorize network traffic as benign or malicious. An Enhanced Osprey Optimization Algorithm (EOOA) minimizes the network’s loss function. The proposed technique is executed on four datasets including CICIDS2017, UNR-IDD, NSL-KDD, and NF-UQ-NIDS-v2, achieving detection accuracies of 99.98 %, 99.44 %, 99.74 %, and 99.95 %, respectively and it outperforms the existing schemes.

AB  - Advanced Persistent Threats(APT) with the purpose of stealing confidential data take place all the time. In the APT life cycle, lateral movement is a critical stage towards high-level authority and confidential data. Existing lateral movement detection mainly concentrates on endpoint protection to distinguish compromised hosts. These approaches not only have unfortunate effect but also can not detect lateral movement behavior comprehensively. We design LMTracker, an attack path detection algorithm based on the heterogeneous graph, in order to make up for above shortcomings. LMTracker consists of three modules: heterogeneous graph construction, path representation generation, and unsupervised anomaly-based attack path detection. The core idea of LMTracker is to use event logs and traffic to establish heterogeneous graphs and generate representation vectors for lateral movement paths, then use unsupervised algorithm to implement anomaly-based path detection. This method can not only detect lateral movement paths effectively but also preserve the path relationships. Security professionals can use these paths to analyze attack activities. In two frequently-used public datasets, the evaluation results demonstrate that LMTracker performs significantly better than other methods and can adapt to attack detection in different scenarios. The area under the ROC curve is as high as 0.95.

AB  - In today's linked digital world, securing computer networks as well as systems is critical. The increasing complexity as well as the regularity of network attacks demand creative and effective intrusion detection solutions to protect against possible threats. Kerberos, an established token-based authentication technology, is notable for its cryptographic method, privacy assurance, and data protection whenever identifying eligible users. At the same time, it fails to offer proper channel protection for transmitting user credentials between the client and server pathways. This study presents an integrated approach for detecting Kerberos attacks and intrusions within computing systems and networks. It combines artificial intelligence and Blockchain technology with a proxy re-encryption scheme to enhance security measures. After pre-processing, the input data is recorded on the blockchain, subjected to proxy re-encryption, and stripped of noise. The utilization of threshold proxy re-encryption in the consensus process eliminates dependence on third-party central service providers. As proxy service nodes, a number of consensus nodes within the blockchain network re-encrypt data and combine translated ciphertext. Throughout the process, no personal information is revealed. In this study, the methods of Principal Component Analysis and Chi-square Test are used to reduce the dimension of the main components with the greatest variation and to discover and pick the most relevant features from the target variable. To detect the normal and attack systems, all selected important features have been categorized utilizing the KNN classifier. Throughout the investigation, the proposed approach was used to evaluate the openly available dataset KDD-99.

AB  - Intrusion detection methods are crucial means to mitigate network security issues. However, the challenges posed by large-scale complex network environments include local information islands, regional privacy leaks, communication burdens, difficulties in handling heterogeneous data, and storage resource bottlenecks. Federated learning has the potential to address these challenges by leveraging widely distributed and heterogeneous data, achieving load balancing of storage and computing resources across multiple nodes, and reducing the risks of privacy leaks and bandwidth resource demands. This paper reviews the process of constructing federated learning based intrusion detection system from the perspective of intrusion detection. Specifically, it outlines six main aspects: application scenario analysis, federated learning methods, privacy and security protection, selection of classification models, data sources and client data distribution, and evaluation metrics, establishing them as key research content. Subsequently, six research topics are extracted based on these aspects. These topics include expanding application scenarios, enhancing aggregation algorithm, enhancing security, enhancing classification models, personalizing model and utilizing unlabeled data. Furthermore, the paper delves into research content related to each of these topics through in-depth investigation and analysis. Finally, the paper discusses the current challenges faced by research, and suggests promising directions for future exploration.

AB  - Accurate time synchronization is fundamental to the correct and efficient operation of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), especially in security-critical, time-sensitive applications. However, most existing protocols degrade substantially under malicious interference. We introduce iSTSP, an Intelligent and Secure Time Synchronization Protocol that implements a four-stage defense pipeline to ensure robust, precise synchronization even in hostile environments: (1) trust preprocessing that filters node participation using behavioral trust scoring; (2) anomaly isolation employing a lightweight autoencoder to detect and excise malicious nodes in real time; (3) reliability-weighted consensus that prioritizes high-trust nodes during time aggregation; and (4) convergence-optimized synchronization that dynamically adjusts parameters using theoretical stability bounds. We provide rigorous convergence analysis including a closed-form expression for convergence time, and validate the protocol through both simulations and real-world experiments on a controlled 16-node testbed. Under Sybil attacks with five malicious nodes within this testbed, iSTSP maintains synchronization error increases under 12% and achieves a rapid convergence. Compared to state-of-the-art protocols like TPSN, SE-FTSP, and MMAR-CTS, iSTSP offers 60% faster detection, broader threat coverage, and more than 7 times lower synchronization error, with a modest 9.3% energy overhead over 8 h. We argue this is an acceptable trade-off for mission-critical deployments requiring guaranteed security. These findings demonstrate iSTSP’s potential as a reliable solution for secure WSN synchronization and motivate future work on large-scale IoT deployments and integration with energy-efficient communication protocols.

AB  - There are various data management and security tools deployed at the cloud for storing and analyzing big data generated by the Internet of Things (IoT) and Industrial IoT (IIoT) systems. There is a recent trend to move such tools to edge networks (closer to the users and the IoT/IIoT systems) to address limitations, especially latency and security issues, in cloud-based solutions. However, protecting edge networks against zero-day attacks is challenging, due to the volume, variety and veracity of data collected from the large numbers of IoT devices in edge networks. In this paper, we propose a Distributed Anomaly Detection (DAD) system to discover zero-day attacks in edge networks. The proposed system uses Gaussian Mixture-based Correntropy, a novel ensemble one-class statistical learning model, which is designed to effectively monitor and recognize zero-day attacks in real-time from edge networks. We also design an IoT-edge-cloud architecture to illustrate the complexity of edge networks and how one can deploy the proposed system at network gateways. The proposed system is evaluated using both NSL-KDD and UNSW-NB15 datasets. The findings reveal that the proposed system achieves better performance, in terms of detection accuracy and processing time, compared with five anomaly detection techniques.

This study posits an innovative paradigm for extracting multidimensional cyber threat-related features from textual depictions of cyber events, leveraging the prowess of GPT. These extracted features serve as inputs for artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning algorithms, including Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Decomposition analysis, and Natural Language Processing (NLP)-based modalities tailored for non-technical cyber strategists. The proposed framework empowers cyber strategists or analysts to articulate inquiries regarding historical cyber incidents in plain English, with the NLP-based interaction facet of the system proffering cogent AI-driven insights in natural language. Furthermore, salient insights, often elusive in dynamic visualizations, are succinctly presented in plain language. Empirical validation of the entire system ensued through autonomous acquisition of semantically enriched contextual information concerning 214 major cyber incidents spanning from 2016 to 2023.

AB  - Inttroduction
To detect cyberattacks and assess risks in cyber-physical systems used in pharmaceutical treatment, this study presents a two-tiered approach that combines machine learning and Internet of Things (IoT) security. By prioritizing risk-based responses and facilitating real-time threat mitigation, it improves system resilience. Drug delivery, patient data management, and healthcare efficiency have all been greatly improved by the incorporation of cyber-physical systems (CPS) into pharmaceutical care services. However, because digital and physical infrastructures are now interconnected, this development has created serious cybersecurity risks. Strong detection and mitigation procedures are necessary because cyberattacks have the potential to compromise patient safety, data integrity, and service reliability. The necessity for a specific cybersecurity architecture for pharmaceutical CPS is highlighted by the fact that current security solutions frequently fall short in addressing real-time threat detection and risk assessment.
Methods
To detect and eliminate cyber threats instantly, the suggested method makes use of sophisticated machine learning models, intrusion detection systems, and Internet of Things security strategies. A risk-estimation system that assesses attacks according to impact, detectability, and risk estimation factor (REF) is included in a two-layered strategy. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method in comparison with existing security frameworks, simulations were conducted. Analysis is performed on important variables such as system resilience, risk quantification, and detection accuracy.
Results
The results of the simulation show that the suggested method improves the accuracy of threat identification and offers a methodical framework for risk evaluation. The strategy demonstrates increased accuracy in detecting cyberattacks and prioritizing mitigation measures when compared to current approaches. By accurately estimating the intensity of an assault, the risk estimation approach guarantees preventative security measures.
Discussion
A comprehensive answer to the changing cybersecurity issues in pharmaceutical CPS is provided by the layered architecture that combines machine learning and IoT security. The suggested approach facilitates informed, risk-based decision-making for mitigation in addition to improving real-time threat detection. This proactive strategy protects sensitive patient data and helps avoid service interruptions. Nevertheless, the study has certain drawbacks, such as reliance on the caliber of training data and the requirement for frequent model upgrades in order to accommodate new threats. Future studies might concentrate on combining adaptive models and federated learning to improve system privacy and adaptability even more.
Conclusion
A unique cybersecurity architecture for intelligent CPS in pharmaceutical care is presented in this paper. The method improves system resilience, protects patient data, and guarantees the dependable functioning of pharmaceutical services against changing cyber threats by combining real-time threat detection with risk assessment.

AB  - The concept of the Internet of Things (IoT) threat surface refers to the overall susceptibility of smart devices to potential security risks. This vulnerability includes the combined impact of security weaknesses, gaps in protective measures, and potential vulnerabilities within the device OS, installed libraries, and applications, as well as the infrastructure involved. This comprises both identified and unforeseen risks that could potentially compromise the device’s integrity, data, logs, and hosted applications. By minimizing the extent to which the device’s components are exposed, it becomes possible to reduce the vulnerabilities inherent in the device, thereby decreasing its overall threat surface area. This research introduces an innovative framework for assessing Smart IoT cameras within the ecosystem. This framework involves the identification and categorization of webcam devices, followed by an analysis of potential threats based on various exposure indicators present within each layer. Subsequently, this information is used to determine the possible paths through which a device might be compromised, allowing for the evaluation of severity and both maturity levels. The authors present metrics that aid in reevaluating and recalibrating the security levels, considering the discovered threat surface elements. These refined metrics offer a fresh perspective on security, offering valuable insights for stakeholders who are engaged in the development, deployment, and evaluation of the security aspects of such devices.

AB  - In the complex environment of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), various malicious attacks have emerged, among which internal attacks pose particularly severe security risks. These attacks seriously threaten network stability, data transmission reliability, and overall performance. To effectively address this issue and significantly improve intrusion detection speed, accuracy, and resistance to malicious attacks, this research designs a Three-level Intrusion Detection Model based on Dynamic Trust Evaluation (TIDM-DTE). This study conducts a detailed analysis of how different attack types impact node trust and establishes node models for data trust, communication trust, and energy consumption trust by focusing on characteristics such as continuous packet loss and energy consumption changes. By dynamically predicting node trust values using the grey Markov model, the model accurately and sensitively reflects changes in node trust levels during attacks. Additionally, DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) data noise monitoring technology is employed to quickly identify attacked nodes, while a trust recovery mechanism restores the trust of temporarily faulty nodes to reduce False Alarm Rate. Simulation results demonstrate that TIDM-DTE achieves high detection rates, fast detection speed, and low False Alarm Rate when identifying various network attacks, including selective forwarding attacks, Sybil attacks, switch attacks, and black hole attacks. TIDM-DTE significantly enhances network security, ensures secure and reliable data transmission, moderately improves network energy efficiency, reduces unnecessary energy consumption, and provides strong support for the stable operation of WSNs. Meanwhile, the research findings offer new ideas and methods for WSN security protection, possessing important theoretical significance and practical application value.

AB  - With the number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices proliferating, the traffic volume of IoT-based attacks has shown a gradually increasing trend. The IoT botnet attack, which aims to commit real, efficient, and profitable cybercrimes, has become one of the most severe IoT threats. Applying traditional techniques to IoT is difficult due to its particular characteristics, such as resource-constrained devices, massive volumes of data, and real-time requirements. In this paper, we explore an adaptive online learning strategy for real-time IoT botnet attack detection. Furthermore, we operate the proposed adaptive strategy in conjunction with online ensemble learning. To evaluate the proposed strategy, we use real IoT traffic data, including benign traffic data and botnet traffic data infected by Mirai. In real-time IoT botnet attack detection, our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed adaptive online learning strategy achieves remarkable performance.

AB  - Despite considerable investments in database security, global statistics indicate an exponential increase in data breaches. Organizations are often unaware of data breaches for weeks, months, or even years. Sufficient for adversaries to compromise and ex-filtrate business or mission-critical data. Recent research suggests using honeytokens for early detection of data breaches in organizations. Existing honeytoken generation methods rely on regular expressions, rule mining, constraint satisfaction, or representation learning, which are complex and limited to a few attributes. We created a framework for generating and deploying honeytokens in relational databases that actively monitor sensitive records and quickly detect data breaches and their misuse. To generate the honeytoken we have used the hierarchical machine learning algorithm which uses a recursive technique to model the parent–child relationships of multi-table databases. The proposed method enables the organization to take remedial action to reduce the impact of data breaches and complement existing database security solutions.

AB  - Cloud computing is flourishing at a rapid pace. Significant consequences related to data security appear as a malicious user may get unauthorized access to sensitive data which may be misused, further. This raises an alarm-ringing situation to tackle the crucial issue related to data security and proactive malicious user prediction. This article proposes a Federated learning driven Malicious User Prediction Model for Secure Data Distribution in Cloud Environments (FedMUP). This approach firstly analyzes user behavior to acquire multiple security risk parameters. Afterward, it employs the federated learning-driven malicious user prediction approach to reveal doubtful users, proactively. FedMUP trains the local model on their local dataset and transfers computed values rather than actual raw data to obtain an updated global model based on averaging various local versions. This updated model is shared repeatedly at regular intervals with the user for retraining to acquire a better, and more efficient model capable of predicting malicious users more precisely. Extensive experimental work and comparison of the proposed model with state-of-the-art approaches demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed work. Significant improvement is observed in the key performance indicators such as malicious user prediction accuracy, precision, recall, and f1-score up to 14.32%, 17.88%, 14.32%, and 18.35%, respectively.

AB  - Transformers, while effective at capturing spatial relationships through self-attention mechanisms, typically rely on LSTM networks only at the end to model sequential dependencies. This limits their ability to fully exploit temporal relationships across all layers. Such limitations impact the performance of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) in Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) environments , where accurate analysis of patient data is essential for detecting known attack signatures, zero-day anomalies, monitoring health trends, and securing healthcare networks. To address these challenges, we propose the Memory Feedback Transformer (MF-Transformer), which integrates Memory Feedback LSTM (MF-LSTM) throughout the entire Transformer architecture to capture and propagate temporal dependencies at every layer. The MF-Transformer first computes spatial-to-spatial relationships by analyzing correlations between features within the same time step, then incorporates spatial-to-temporal relationships by integrating the hidden state from the MF-LSTM to capture temporal dynamics via a feedback loop. By combining spatial and temporal patterns, the MF-Transformer retains long-term dependencies, tracks temporal dynamics effectively, and enhances anomaly detection, identifying both short-term deviations and long-term trends. Comprehensive evaluations on three publicly available datasets, WUSTL-EHMS-2020, ECU-IoHT, and X-IIoTID demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed MF-Transformer, achieving accuracy rates of 99.88%, 99.42%, and 99.12% for signature detection, and 99.98%, 99.71%, and 99.18% for anomaly detection, respectively.

AB  - The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) harmonizes smart devices, machines, and intelligent technologies to improve production efficiency through the information-centric network. Information-Centric Networking (ICN) is a potentially useful method in control sequences and intelligent operations due to adversary impacts. Here, the sharing of content chunks between different machines' varying control spans and operation cycles has been partially connected to the internet. This article introduces a Variant Loop Detection and Mitigation Model (VLDMM) for preventing illegitimate entries in ICN. The proposed model is backboned by recurrent learning for training the loop closures and time achievements in ICN. The harmonization is utilized under different production outputs observed from the previous cycles. The interruptions and process halts are identified using recurrent training by correlating the previous operation logs in ICN. Therefore, ICN may solve the challenges based on the available control slots and variations. This learning retains the production efficiency and prevents halts under controlled time and loop closures.

AB  - The rapid growth of technology has increased interconnected large-scale systems, broadening the attack surface for malicious actors. Traditional security solutions often employ centralised management of components like firewalls and intrusion detection systems for consistent configuration. This centralisation introduces a ”single point of failure,” risking severe consequences if compromised. While redundancy can mitigate concerns in IT systems, it does not scale well for larger systems. Edge computing, which pushes computation closer to endpoint devices, has been explored to improve scalability. The research community has also explored distributing and decentralising cybersecurity operations, especially intrusion detection, using new machine learning methods that mix centralised and distributed approaches to scale effectively while preserving data privacy. However, challenges remain in implementing these methods in large-scale IoT systems due to resource constraints. This paper evaluates intrusion detection methods in large-scale, resource-limited IoT systems, exploring the benefits of low-powered devices for network security and discussing solutions to current implementation challenges.

AB  - The number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices is expanding quickly as IoT gradually spreads to all aspects of life. At the same time, IoT devices have emerged as a new attack medium for attack groups, and IoT security becomes an urgent issue to be solved. Attackers often evade intrusion detection using disguises, and attack methods against the IoT continue to evolve over time. To effectively identify malicious traffic, we propose a method for anomaly detection based on attribute graphs to identify potential security vulnerabilities in IoT traffic. The nodes of the attribute graph are values of features extracted from network traffic, with a meta-path-based graph neural network learning the topology and attribute information of the traffic network. To assure the model’s performance under large-scale IoT nodes, we develop a Hoffman coding-based data accuracy adjustment strategy to optimize the data, which regulates the size of the attribute graph under various data sizes. Our extensive experiments on datasets of real network traffic show the effectiveness of our method.

AB  - This paper presents a comprehensive system for detecting and defending against distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) and distributed reflective denial-of-service (DRDoS) flood attacks in software-defined networking (SDN) environments using Programming Protocol-Independent Packet Processors (P4). The proposed system introduces a hybrid intrusion statistical threshold algorithm (HISTA) that analyzes intrusion data statistics to identify potential malicious attacks. Upon detection, the system utilises P4 programmability to implement a custom defence mechanism on the P4 switch. A novel Uruk protocol header collaborates with HISTA for enhanced cross-layer attack detection and categorisation. The HISTA-Uruk mechanism selectively discards malicious packets while ensuring uninterrupted communication for legitimate packets, effectively preventing DDoS/DRDoS attacks. Extensive experiments validate the system’s ability to efficiently detect and thwart various DDoS, DRDoS, and internal attacks, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying threats and restoring impacted network connections across diverse attack scenarios.

AB  - The increasing complexity and dynamic nature of modern Information Systems (IS) and evolving cybersecurity threats pose significant challenges for organizations in managing information security. Traditional methods often focus on isolated security aspects, failing to capture the intricate interdependencies between internal and external threats, vulnerabilities, and defensive strategies. These limitations necessitate a holistic approach that can comprehensively model and analyze the interactions within IS environments. Motivated to address these research gaps, we developed SD-ABM-ISM, a multi-method framework integrating System Dynamics (SD) and Agent-Based Modeling (ABM). This framework is designed to capture the complex dynamics of IS, incorporating insider and outsider threats and their interactions with defensive measures. SD-ABM-ISM enables an in-depth examination of how various threat actors impact security outcomes and how proactive and reactive investment strategies influence the resilience of the IS. The proposed framework provides a unique approach to understanding multi-actor threat dynamics and their effect on IS over time, facilitating informed decision-making for security investments. The framework offers a robust tool for security decision-makers, enabling organizations to align their security strategies with the evolving threat surface and enhance their resilience against cyberattacks. The detailed simulation and statistical analysis identify the influential elements in the IS over time, highlighting the impact of interactions between insider threats, outsider threats, and the IS itself in an environment characterized by high uncertainty and diverse threat behaviors. The insights from these interactions demonstrate how coordinated threats from multiple actors can amplify vulnerabilities while effective security measures can mitigate these risks. Considering proactive and reactive security investment strategies, SD-ABM-ISM provides a dynamic and cost-effective security investment strategy to protect IS from adversaries with various behaviors.

AB  - Within both the cyber kill chain and MITRE ATT&CK frameworks, Lateral Movement (LM) is defined as any activity that allows adversaries to progressively move deeper into a system in seek of high-value assets. Although this timely subject has been studied in the cybersecurity literature to a significant degree, so far, no work provides a comprehensive survey regarding the identification of LM from mainly an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) viewpoint. To cover this noticeable gap, this work provides a systematic, holistic overview of the topic, not neglecting new communication paradigms, such as the Internet of Things (IoT). The survey part, spanning a time window of eight years and 53 articles, is split into three focus areas, namely, Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) schemes, machine learning oriented solutions, and graph-based strategies. On top of that, we bring to light interrelations, mapping the progress in this field over time, and offer key observations that may propel LM research forward.

AB  - The paper proposes a model for authenticating mobile access subjects in a critical system. The incident detection mechanism is based on training and classification of the user activity audit log dataset embedded in the underlying configuration of the content management system. The proposed mechanisms can be implemented in systems whose subjects have some terrain movement patterns (within a city, district). The proposed model eliminates the disadvantages of existing traditional authentication methods based on the use of explicit verification methods. KNN methods, SVM and random forest algorithm are used for classification. These classification methods are formalized mathematically in the context of the set authentication problem, and to confirm the effectiveness of the algorithm, the robustness of the model by Euclidean metric and Chebyshev metric is evaluated, as well as the information content of the input features that affect the classification by each of the considered methods.

AB  - This paper proposed an Artificial Intelligence (AI) enhanced Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) based comprehensive framework used to improve security, privacy, scalability and efficiency in forensic investigations for the multi-cloud environment, a growing concern for cybersecurity and digital forensics domains. With the growing invulnerability of data storage and inefficient processing in cloud computing landscapes, forensic investigations confront privacy preservation, data integrity, and interoperability issues amongst various cloud providers. Despite existing frameworks, there are few adaptive solutions that holistically solve these challenges. To address such issues and challenges, we propose a suite of frameworks, including an Adaptive Multi-Cloud Forensic Integration Framework (A-MCFIF), Multi-Factor Access Control Framework (MACF), Adaptive ZKP Optimization Framework (AZOF), and Privacy Enhanced Data Security Framework (PDSF) to bridge this gap. Incorporating AI-enhanced ZKP and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), these frameworks secure data and improve the efficiency of proof generation and verification while meeting privacy regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). Our extensive evaluation of the proposed framework included computing efficiency, memory consumption, data handling efficiency, scalability, overall performance, and cost-effectiveness. We also analyse verification latency to assess the framework’s real-time processing capabilities, which overcome existing solutions. Furthermore, our research includes cloud-specific threat models such as insider threats and data breaches and shows the benefits of the proposed framework for counteracting these risks by proving mathematical and empirical security against privacy breaches. Finally, we bring new insights and contribute to the development of secure, privacy-compliant, and efficient forensic processes, which are elaborated as a comprehensive solution for more reconstructive forensic initiatives in increasingly sophisticated cloud environments.

AB  - Personality detection is an emerging task benefiting numerous fields. The existing studies on text-based personality detection rarely concern silent users who never publish social texts due to the lack of their posts. Simultaneously, the mainstream methods lack an effective pathway for silent user representation to detect the personality. To solve the silent user problems, we propose a psycholinguistic knowledge-guided graph network, PKGN. Our method is composed of neighbor post metric, graph initialization & learning, and classification. Under the guidance of psychological knowledge, our model first selects high-quality posts from neighbors as the posts of silent users through the neighbor post metric. In the graph initialization & learning, psychologically relevant categories are introduced to build the bipartite graph for each silent user and obtain the user representation via GATv2. Then, we utilize linear classifiers for personality classification. We conducted extensive experiments on a new real-world dataset, including 1581 samples. To conduct a baseline benchmark for the silent user personality detection task, we apply the neighbor post metric to combine with the existing work. From the experimental results, our model achieves 64.11% average accuracy and 63.21% average macro-F1, outperforming mainstream methods in most individual personality traits and comprehensive comparisons. Furthermore, the introduction of psycholinguistic knowledge benefits the model performance. In neighbor post metric comparison, the psycholinguistic knowledge from LIWC reduces the standard variances of psychological category count and improves the detection results (3.01% ↑ for average accuracy and 2.34% ↑ for average macro-F1). In the ablation study, all the psychologically relevant categories contribute to the model performance (ranging from 0.02% ↑ to 3.02% ↑ for average macro-F1).

AB  - Industrial Control Systems (ICSs), widely employed in many critical infrastructure sectors that manage and control physical processes (e.g., energy, water, transportation), face heightened security risks due to increased digitization and connectivity. Monitoring Indicators of Compromise (IoCs), observable signs of intrusion, such as unusual network activity or unauthorized system changes, are crucial for early detection and response to malicious activities, including data breaches and insider threats. While IoCs have been extensively studied in traditional Information Technology (IT), their effectiveness and suitability for the unique challenges of ICS environments, which directly control physical processes, remain unclear. Moreover, the influence of human factors (e.g., sociotechnical factors, usability) on the utilization and interpretation of IoCs for attack prevention in ICSs is not well understood. To address this gap, we conducted two studies involving 52 ICS security professionals. In an IoC Applicability study (n=32), we explore the relevance of existing IoCs within ICS environments and investigate factors contributing to potential ambiguities in their interpretation. We examine the perceived value, effort required for the collection, and volatility of various data sources used for IoC identification. Participants in the IoC Applicability Study emphasized the significant role of human factors in recognizing and interpreting IoCs for threat mitigation within ICS ecosystems. Based on this insight, we conducted a Socio-technical Factors in Recognition and Detection study (n=20) to investigate the impact of human factors on threat detection and explore the sociotechnical factors that influence the effective utilization of IoCs. Our results show significant discrepancies between conventional IT-based IoCs and their applicability to ICS environments, along with various socio-technical challenges (e.g., alert overload and desensitization). Our study provides pointers to rethinking the specific operational, technological, and human aspects of IoCs within the ICS context. Our findings provide insights for the development of ICS-specific IoC to enable security analysts to better respond to potential threats in industrial environments.

AB  - The escalating sophistication of cyberattacks, exemplified by supply chain compromises, AI-driven obfuscation, and politically motivated campaigns, makes accurate attribution a critical yet elusive challenge for national security and economic stability. The inability to reliably trace attacks to their source undermines deterrence, distorts policy responses, and erodes trust in digital ecosystems. Traditional methods struggle with the sheer volume of digital evidence, rapidly evolving adversary tactics, and the inherent complexities of cross-border operations. Moreover, existing literature often provides fragmented analyses, focuses narrowly on cyber threat intelligence sharing or specific threat types, or predates significant advancements in AI/ML tailored for attribution. This survey offers a comprehensive, interdisciplinary review of cyber threat attribution, bridging these critical gaps by systematically analyzing its multifaceted dimensions: technical, legal, geopolitical, social, and economic. Employing a rigorous, PRISMA-ScR compliant methodology that included structured screening and quality assessment across six major databases, we critically appraise current techniques and identify a paradigm shift toward data-driven, intelligent approaches. A key contribution is our novel taxonomy, which structures attribution research by attribution confidence & granularity (the Level of attribution), analytical domains (the “How” and “Where” of evidence processing) and adversarial motivation & profile (the “Why” and “Who”), providing a crucial framework for systematic cross-study comparisons in a complex field. Our findings underscore the transformative potential of emerging AI/ML techniques, particularly graph neural networks, in automating analysis, identifying subtle patterns, and extracting crucial insights from vast datasets, thereby revolutionizing attribution accuracy. This research provides actionable insights for practitioners and policymakers, offering a comprehensive roadmap to advance cyber defense and foster a more resilient and secure global digital ecosystem.

AB  - Internet of Things (IoT) networks have rapidly transformed various sectors, including modern warfare, where Internet of Military Vehicles (IoMVs) enable remote connection, monitoring, and data sharing. However, IoMV sensors lack inherent security measures to combat threats such as DDoS, jamming, and spoofing. Traditional security solutions relying on AI face challenges such as inefficient feature selection, lack of transparency, and susceptibility to data tampering. In this paper, we propose an AI and Blockchain based secure data exchange architecture for battlefield IoMV networks. Our approach employs an Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) technique for optimal feature selection and uses five different Machine Learning algorithms to classify malicious and non-malicious data. Notably, the XGBoost model achieves an accuracy of 98.8%. Non-malicious data is securely forwarded to a blockchain network, where a smart contract validates its legitimacy, and stored off-chain using the Inter-Planetary File System (IPFS) to enhance scalability and reduce storage costs. Additionally, leveraging low latency 5G communication ensures rapid and reliable data transmission. This integration of AI for real-time threat detection, blockchain for tamper-proof storage, and 5G for enhanced communication significantly improves battlefield operations by enabling secure and efficient decision-making.

AB  - A crucial technical challenge for cybercriminals is to keep control over the potentially millions of infected devices that build up their botnets, without compromising the robustness of their attacks. A single, fixed C&C server, for example, can be trivially detected either by binary or traffic analysis and immediately sink-holed or taken-down by security researchers or law enforcement. Botnets often use Domain Generation Algorithms (DGAs), primarily to evade take-down attempts. DGAs can enlarge the lifespan of a malware campaign, thus potentially enhancing its profitability. They can also contribute to hindering attack accountability. In this work, we introduce HYDRAS, the most comprehensive and representative dataset of Algorithmically-Generated Domains (AGD) available to date. The dataset contains more than 100 DGA families, including both real-world and adversarially designed ones. We analyse the dataset and discuss the possibility of differentiating between benign requests (to real domains) and malicious ones (to AGDs) in real-time. The simultaneous study of so many families and variants introduces several challenges; nonetheless, it alleviates biases found in previous literature employing small datasets which are frequently overfitted, exploiting characteristic features of particular families that do not generalise well. We thoroughly compare our approach with the current state-of-the-art and highlight some methodological shortcomings in the actual state of practice. The outcomes obtained show that our proposed approach significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art in terms of both classification performance and efficiency.

AB  - The increasing complexity of decision-making in dynamic environments, particularly in high-stakes domains like cybersecurity, demands more than automated solutions—it requires effective integration of human expertise with advanced AI capabilities. While approaches like ensemble learning and Mixture of Experts (MoE) enhance automated decision-making, they struggle with handling uncertainty and novel scenarios. Techniques such as learning to defer and learning to complement mitigate this by incorporating human input, but assume that a definitive expert is always available—an assumption that often fails in real-world settings. To bridge this gap, we introduce A2C, a modular, multi-stage collaborative decision-making framework that enhances adaptability and decision robustness under uncertainty by seamlessly transitioning between three decision-making modes: Automated, Augmented Deferral, and Collaborative Exploration (CoEx). A key innovation of CoEX is its ability to handle cases where both AI and human experts face uncertainty, overcoming a critical limitation of traditional deferral systems. We validate A2C through experiments on benchmark datasets, Large Language Model (LLM) simulations of human–AI collaboration, and real-world human–AI interaction studies with cybersecurity researchers. Results show that A2C consistently outperforms conventional approaches that rely solely on full automation or selective human intervention, demonstrating its potential as a practical and scalable solution for expert decision-making in complex domains. For image detection on CIFAR-10, detection rates improved from 37.8% with automation alone to 64.75% with augmented deferral, and further to 92.95% with collaborative exploration. Similarly, for intrusion detection on KDDCup, rates rose from 33.43% with automation to 35.18% with augmented deferral, and finally reached 87.04% with CoEx, highlighting its effectiveness in handling uncertainty.

AB  - Reproducibility of network intrusion detection research necessitates widely available datasets that represent real-world scenarios. One of the key omissions of existing datasets used in empirical evaluations of network intrusions is the lack of human-generated traffic with accurate labels to distinguish benign and malicious behavior. Using an emulated network environment with a vulnerable web application, we collected baseline traffic, human-generated normal user traffic, automated attacks, and the attacks of ten human penetration testers of varying abilities. We preprocessed this collected data to produce a new dataset named the Colorado University Pentesting Intrusion Dataset (CUPID). The attacks span from reconnaissance activities to delivery of an exploit payload. To our knowledge, this is the first collection that provides labeled, Institutional Review Board-approved, benign and attacker data that is publicly available. The CUPID dataset can be used to train and test the limits of classification-based machine learning algorithms used for network intrusion detection systems.

AB  - With the rapid development of Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) technologies, the security of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) data faces increasing challenges, particularly in time series anomaly detection. IIoT data are typically scarce in abnormal samples and noisy, making unsupervised learning a common solution. The security challenges of IIoT data in AIoT environments require robust unsupervised anomaly detection methods. While Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) excel in noise resilience, they face two critical challenges in IIoT data: difficulties in single-variable time-series modeling and conflicts between static prior assumptions and dynamic temporal features. To address these challenges, we propose the Greater Cane Rat Algorithm-enhanced Fourier-Wavelet Conditional Variational Autoencoder (GCRA-FWVAE). Our method introduces a time-frequency dual-branch architecture that synergistically combines wavelet transforms for localized transient feature extraction and Fourier transforms for global spectral characterization. These complementary representations jointly regulate the Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) reconstruction process, effectively preserving critical anomaly signatures while suppressing noise interference. The architecture is further optimized through bioinspired Greater Cane Rat Algorithm (GCRA) to improve adaptive learning capabilities. Extensive validation on the Yahoo benchmark indicates state-of-the-art performance, achieving an F1-score of 93.6% (an improvement of 4.5% over baseline VAEs) and a precision of 95.1%. These improvements significantly increase anomaly detection accuracy and robustness, particularly in the AIoT environment, where it effectively handles more complex and dynamic industrial data.

AB  - In Industry 4.0, interconnected systems and real-time communication are vital for seamless operations but expose industrial networks to sophisticated cyber threats. Traditional intrusion detection systems often fail to address modern, evolving attacks. This paper presents a novel cyber threat detection approach using a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) model integrated with GloVe word embeddings and a self-attention mechanism. GloVe captures global co-occurrence relationships in network events, enhancing contextual representation and detection accuracy. To handle class imbalance, random oversampling balances attack category distributions, followed by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for feature reduction. The model's parameters are fine-tuned using the Single Candidate Optimization Algorithm (SCOA) and Greylag Goose Optimization Algorithm (GLGOA), improving computational efficiency and detection performance. Evaluation on the CIC-IDS-2018 dataset demonstrates superior accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score compared to state-of-the-art methods. The model effectively detects intrusions and prioritizes high-risk threats, strengthening cybersecurity in Industry 4.0 environments. This adaptable framework can be enhanced to address more complex attack patterns, ensuring robust protection for critical infrastructures.

AB  - Identification of human malicious behaviors is a demanding problem in nuclear security due to its potential to cause huge personnel and economic casualties. With the visibly rapid development of deep learning technology especially computer vision, the automatic identification of human malicious behaviors become feasible, offering significant savings in human resources. However, there is few research focusing on the explainable reasoning process based on the calculation results of computer vision. In this paper, an innovative framework is proposed, which contains two modules called computer vision module and reasoning module. Among them, the computer vision module could extract and detect human actions by some computer vision technologies, while these actions would be comprehensively utilized in reasoning module to derive the reasoning results. Furthermore, within the reasoning module, three novel reasoning methods are developed which are data-based reasoning method, language-based reasoning method and graph-based reasoning method. For evaluating the practicality and effectiveness of these methods, experiments are conducted on four typical scenarios in nuclear security, which are normal status, fence climbing, wire cutting and weapon holding. The results show that the proposed language-based reasoning method turns out to be the best one, which obtain a higher precision value of 0.7917 and a perfect recall value of 1.0000.

AB  - The proactive detection of advanced adversarial behaviors remains a critical challenge for Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) platforms, particularly as attackers adopt stealthy, multi-phase campaigns. This paper presents a cross-platform, MITRE ATT&CK aligned evaluation framework for systematically measuring the SIEM detection coverage, responsiveness, and accuracy. The framework was demonstrated through the Wazuh SIEM platform and atomic red team testing, targeting four high-impact tactics: Collection, Command-and-Control (C2), Exfiltration, and Impact. The results show a high detection rate for C2 and Impact techniques, and partial detection for Collection and Ex-filtration tactics owing to gaps in correlation and telemetry depth. The overall detection rate was approximately 85%, with platform-specific differences driven by the endpoint logging capabilities. Quantitative performance analysis yielded a precision of 91.4%, recall of 85.2%, and false positive rate of 4.8%, confirming both detection effectiveness and operational feasibility. The main contributions of this study are as follows: (i) a reproducible, ATT&CK aligned framework adaptable to both open source and commercial SIEMs, (ii) actionable detection rule enhancements to improve Security Operations Centerwork (SOC) operations, and (iii) scalability considerations for deployment in enterprise environments. By integrating structured adversary modeling with operational SOCs flows, the proposed framework advances proactive cyber defence in complex enterprise environments.

AB  - Database systems have consistently been prime targets for cyber-attacks and threats due to the critical nature of the data they store. Despite the increasing reliance on database management systems, this field continues to face numerous cyber-attacks. Database management systems serve as the foundation of any information system or application. Any cyber-attack can result in significant damage to the database system and loss of sensitive data. Consequently, cyber risk classifications and assessments play a crucial role in risk management and establish an essential framework for identifying and responding to cyber threats. Risk assessment aids in understanding the impact of cyber threats and developing appropriate security controls to mitigate risks. The primary objective of this study is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of cyber risks in database management systems, including classifying threats, vulnerabilities, impacts, and countermeasures. This classification helps to identify suitable security controls to mitigate cyber risks for each type of threat. Additionally, this research aims to explore technical countermeasures to protect database systems from cyber threats. This study employs the content analysis method to collect, analyze, and classify data in terms of types of threats, vulnerabilities, and countermeasures. The results indicate that SQL injection attacks and Denial of Service (DoS) attacks were the most prevalent technical threats in database systems, each accounting for 9% of incidents. Vulnerable audit trails, intrusion attempts, and ransomware attacks were classified as the second level of technical threats in database systems, comprising 7% and 5% of incidents, respectively. Furthermore, the findings reveal that insider threats were the most common non-technical threats in database systems, accounting for 5% of incidents. Moreover, the results indicate that weak authentication, unpatched databases, weak audit trails, and multiple usage of an account were the most common technical vulnerabilities in database systems, each accounting for 9% of vulnerabilities. Additionally, software bugs, insecure coding practices, weak security controls, insecure networks, password misuse, weak encryption practices, and weak data masking were classified as the second level of security vulnerabilities in database systems, each accounting for 4% of vulnerabilities. The findings from this work can assist organizations in understanding the types of cyber threats and developing robust strategies against cyber-attacks.

AB  - This study explores the impact of biosignal-based attention monitoring on train driver performance in the context of smartphone usage, a critical factor influencing railroad safety. The persistent problem of smartphone distractions, which severely impair situational awareness and contribute to accidents, necessitates innovative solutions to enhance operational safety. To address this issue, this study develops an electroencephalogram (EEG)-based system for detecting smartphone usage in train drivers and analyzing its effects on cognitive performance. A full-type train simulator was used to replicate real-world train operations, where EEG data were collected from 25 participants under two experimental conditions: (1) train driving with smartphone usage, and (2) train driving without smartphone usage. A deep learning-based classification model, utilizing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, was developed to analyze EEG signals and detect smartphone-related cognitive impairments. The model achieved an accuracy of 85.6% in distinguishing smartphone usage states, demonstrating its effectiveness in detecting cognitive changes associated with smartphone distractions. Furthermore, the findings indicate that smartphone usage leads to a 1.4x increase in response time to critical situations, significantly impacting reaction times and error rates. Unlike traditional behavior-based monitoring methods, this study pioneers an objective, real-time EEG-based smartphone usage detection system, offering a proactive strategy for accident prevention in railroad operations. By integrating deep learning with biosignal analysis, this research contributes to the advancement of real-time safety monitoring systems, providing new insights into human performance assessment in high-risk environments.

AB  - Database security focuses on protecting most organization’s virtual data storage unit and confidential information from malicious threats and external attacks. To keep out data secure, we need to use a role-based access control (RBAC) approach to accurately differentiate access permissions, but SQL queries written by an authorized user have very similar characteristics and are difficult to distinguish. In this paper, we propose a method of optimizing CNN-LSTM neural networks with particle swarm optimization (PSO) to classify the roles in RBAC system. Convolutional neural network (CNN) can extract parsed SQL queries into smaller details and features through an analysis mechanism. Long short-term memory (LSTM) is also suitable for modeling the temporal information of SQL queries to recognize the context of user authorities. PSO repeatedly searches and optimizes the complex hyperparameter space of the CNN-LSTM. Our PSO-based CNN-LSTM neural networks outperform other deep learning and machine learning models in the TPC-E benchmark SQL query statement. Finally, experiments and analysis show the usefulness of PSO and identify the important SQL query features that affect user role classification.

This paper introduces DDoSBERT, an innovative approach harnessing transformer text classification for DDoS detection. The methodology conducts a detailed exploration of feature selection methods, emphasizing the selection of critical techniques, including Correlation, Mutual Information, and Univariate Feature Selection. Motivated by the dynamic landscape of DDoS attacks, DDoSBERT confronts contemporary challenges such as binary and multi-attack classification and imbalance attack classification. The methodology delves into diverse text transformation techniques for feature selection and employs three transformer classification models: distilbert-base-uncased, prunebert-base-uncased-6-finepruned-w-distil-mnli, and distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english. Additionally, the paper outlines a comprehensive framework for assessing the importance of features in the context of five DDoS datasets, comprised of APA-DDoS, CRCDDoS2022, DDoS Attack SDN, CIC-DDoS-2019, and BCCC-cPacket-Cloud-DDoS-2024 datasets. The experimental results, rigorously evaluated against relevant benchmarks, affirm the efficacy of DDoSBERT, underscoring its significance in enhancing the resilience of systems against text-based transformation DDoS attacks.

The objective of this paper is to examine the role of human factors in the cybersecurity landscape of both smart and cognitive cities. Through a literature review, we investigate how human interactions with digital infrastructures impact security and privacy. We highlight the need to address human errors, social engineering attacks, and insider threats while distinguishing how differences in infrastructure, intelligence, and citizen roles between smart and cognitive cities shape the management of human-centric vulnerabilities. Our review of existing research on integrating human behavioral data into AI systems suggests significant threat detection and response improvements. The findings suggest that human-centric AI detection tools not only mitigate risks of human errors and latent failures but also significantly improve protection for vulnerable populations, thereby promoting stronger human-AI collaboration. Ultimately, this paper advocates for advancing these tools to bolster urban cybersecurity frameworks.

AB  - The adoption of sustainable electronic healthcare infrastructure has revolutionized healthcare services and ensured that E-health technology caters efficiently and promptly to the needs of the stakeholders associated with healthcare. Despite the phenomenal advancement in the present healthcare services, the major obstacle that mars the success of E-health is the issue of ensuring the confidentiality and privacy of the patients’ data. A thorough scan of several research studies reveals that healthcare data continues to be the most sought after entity by cyber invaders. Various approaches and methods have been practiced by researchers to secure healthcare digital services. However, there are very few from the Machine learning (ML) domain even though the technique has the proactive ability to detect suspicious accesses against Electronic Health Records (EHRs). The main aim of this work is to conduct a systematic analysis of the existing research studies that address healthcare data confidentiality issues through ML approaches. B.A. Kitchenham guidelines have been practiced as a manual to conduct this work. Seven well-known digital libraries namely IEEE Xplore, Science Direct, Springer Link, ACM Digital Library, Willey Online Library, PubMed (Medical and Bio-Science), and MDPI have been included to perform an exhaustive search for the existing pertinent studies. Results of this study depict that machine learning provides a more robust security mechanism for sustainable management of the EHR systems in a proactive fashion, yet the specified area has not been fully explored by the researchers. K-nearest neighbor algorithm and KNIEM implementation tools are mostly used to conduct experiments on EHR systems’ log data. Accuracy and performance measure of practiced techniques are not sufficiently outlined in the primary studies. This research endeavour depicts that there is a need to analyze the dynamic digital healthcare environment more comprehensively. Greater accuracy and effective implementation of ML-based models are the need of the day for ensuring the confidentiality of EHRs in a proactive fashion.

AB  - Complex multi-step attacks have caused significant damage to numerous critical infrastructures. Recognizing the pattern of such attacks is a challenging task, and graph neural network based methods have shown promising results via modeling the system’s events as a graph. However, existing methods still face several limitations when deployed in practice. First, there is a lack of sufficient real attack data especially considering the large volume of normal data. Second, attack patterns are complex and evolve over time due to the dynamic and heterogeneous nature of events. Third, the lack of explanation in learned models undermines the trustworthiness of such methods in production environments. To address the above challenges, in this paper, we propose an attack detection method, Trace2Vec. The approach first designs an corruption function to augment rare attack samples, and integrates them into the event graphs. Next, it models the event graphs via a continuous-time dynamic heterogeneous graph neural network. Finally, it employs the Monte Carlo tree search algorithm to identify events with greater contributions to the attack, thus enhancing the explainability of the detection result. We have implemented a prototype for Trace2Vec, and the experimental evaluations demonstrate its superior detection and explanation performance compared to existing methods.

AB  - With the widespread adoption of Artificial intelligence (AI), AI-based tools and components are becoming omnipresent in today’s solutions. However, these components and tools are posing a significant threat when it comes to adversarial attacks. Mobile Crowdsensing (MCS) is a sensing paradigm that leverages the collective participation of workers and their smart devices to collect data. One of the key challenges faced at the selection stage is ensuring task completion due to workers’ varying behavior. AI has been utilized to tackle this challenge by building unique models for each worker to predict their behavior. However, the integration of AI into the system introduces vulnerabilities that can be exploited by malicious insiders to reduce the revenue obtained by victim workers. This work proposes an adversarial attack targeting behavioral-based selection models in MCS. The proposed attack leverages Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate poisoning points that can mislead the models during the training stage without being detected. This way, the potential damage introduced by GANs on worker selection in MCS can be anticipated. Simulation results using a real-life dataset show the effectiveness of the proposed attack in compromising the victim workers’ model and evading detection by an outlier detector, compared to a benchmark. In addition, the impact of the attack on reducing the payment obtained by victim workers is evaluated.

AB  - The ever-growing number of cyber crimes and incidents (i.e., data breaches, privilege escalation, and masquerade attacks) indicates that traditional cyber defense mechanisms designed to manage access control and understand human behavioral intent are unable to protect large organizations against organized malicious attacks. The existing state-of-the-art solutions, extensively rely on human decision making and correlation-based analysis, to understand the anomalous intent of an insider. This consequently leads to data breaches, hence making insider threats one of the biggest challenges faced by the cybersecurity community today. To deal with these issues, new access control architectures and models must focus on the integration of threat analytics, auto-resiliency, and fast response time to mitigate an ongoing threat in a timely manner. In this article, to address these issues and limitations, we propose an integrated access control policy regulation framework, designed on biological principles. The proposed framework provides the ground to efficiently integrate Threat Analytics with Policy Regulation Mechanism against insider threats. Another major contribution of this article is to model access control policy regulation mechanism as an auto-regulatory state transition system, which could autonomously change its state (policy configuration) in real-time against an emergent insider threat. As the last step, with the help of formal methods, we rigorously verify, evaluate, and test the performance of our proposed systems on a real-life threat test dataset.

AB  - Cloud computing has transformed data storage and access by providing scalable and on-demand services. Nevertheless, it remains a priority issue to ensure the protection of sensitive data in cloud environments. Several existing security methods has fundamental shortcomings like poor threat prediction features, a failure to process encrypted data securely and high encryption time. To overcome these issues, this study proposes a novel secure key based cloud security utilizing Three-Way Protection with Martino Homomorphic Encryption for preventing unauthorized data access (SKCS-TWP-MHE-PUDA). Initially, the data are collected from Enron Email dataset. Then the input data is given to Reverse Lognormal Kalman Filter (RLKF) for data cleaning and normalization. Next, Koopman Theory Graph Convolutional Network (KTGCN) is used to analyze packet status, predict potential threats and prevent unauthorized cloud access. This real-time intrusion detection mechanism enables early anticipation of malicious activity. Meanwhile, Martino Homomorphic Encryption (MHE) is used to ensure data confidentiality by encrypting cloud-stored data such that only legitimate users decrypt and access it. The three-way security mechanism comprising user registration, intrusion detection and intrusion prevention strengthens overall protection. The performance of the proposed SKCS-TWP-MHE-PUDA method provides 26.68%, 25.75%, and 26.16% higher accuracy 29.08%, 30.70% and 16.26% higher precision when compared with existing techniques: Stochastic Gradient Descent long short-term memory dependent secure encryption approach for cloud data storage and retrieval in cloud computing environs (SGDLSTM-CDS-CCE), Blockchain Key Management: A Solution for Cloud Data Security (AES-BKY-CDS) and deep learning method with cryptographic transformation for enhancing data security in cloud environs (SqueezeNet-DS-CE) respectively.

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) envisions a smart environment powered by connectivity and heterogeneity where ensuring reliable services and communications across multiple industries, from financial fields to healthcare and fault detection systems, is a top priority. In such fields, data is being collected and broadcast at high speed on a continuous and real-time scale, including IoT in the streaming processing paradigm. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) rely on manually defined security policies and signatures that fail to design a real-time solution or prevent zero-day attacks. Therefore, anomaly detection appears as a prominent solution capable of recognizing patterns, learning from experience, and detecting abnormal behavior. However, most approaches do not fit the urged requirements, often evaluated on deprecated datasets not representative of the working environment. As a result, our contributions address an overview of cybersecurity threats in IoT, important recommendations for a real-time IDS, and a real-time dataset setting to evaluate a security system covering multiple cyber threats. The dataset used to evaluate current host-based IDS approaches is publicly available and can be used as a benchmark by the community.

AB  - Machine learning and Artificial Intelligence (AI) already support human decision-making and complement professional roles, and are expected in the future to be sufficiently trusted to make autonomous decisions. To trust AI systems with such tasks, a high degree of confidence in their behaviour is needed. However, such systems can make drastically different decisions if the input data is modified, in a way that would be imperceptible to humans. The field of Adversarial Machine Learning studies how this feature could be exploited by an attacker and the countermeasures to defend against them. This work examines the Fast Gradient Signed Method (FGSM) attack, a novel Single Value attack and the Label Flip attack on a trending architecture, namely a 1-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network model used for time series classification. The results show that the architecture was susceptible to these attacks and that, in their face, the classifier accuracy was significantly impacted.

AB  - The proliferation and application of machine learning-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) have allowed for more flexibility and efficiency in the automated detection of cyber attacks in Industrial Control Systems (ICS). However, the introduction of such IDSs has also created an additional attack vector; the learning models may also be subject to cyber attacks, otherwise referred to as Adversarial Machine Learning (AML). Such attacks may have severe consequences in ICS systems, as adversaries could potentially bypass the IDS. This could lead to delayed attack detection which may result in infrastructure damages, financial loss, and even loss of life. This paper explores how adversarial learning can be used to target supervised models by generating adversarial samples using the Jacobian-based Saliency Map attack and exploring classification behaviours. The analysis also includes the exploration of how such samples can support the robustness of supervised models using adversarial training. An authentic power system dataset was used to support the experiments presented herein. Overall, the classification performance of two widely used classifiers, Random Forest and J48, decreased by 6 and 11 percentage points when adversarial samples were present. Their performances improved following adversarial training, demonstrating their robustness towards such attacks.

AB  - The widespread deployment of Internet of Things (IoT) devices across various smart city applications presents significant security challenges, increased by the rapidly evolving landscape of cyber threats. Traditional security solutions, including those using Federated Learning with federated averaging, suffer from inefficiencies due to random node selection and partial data sampling, which can hinder the detection of comprehensive network-wide attacks. This paper introduces a novel Cyberthreat Detection System for IoT networks that leverages Digital Twin technology and an optimized Federated Learning approach. Our hypothesis implies integrating Digital Twin models within an IoT security framework to improve real-time cyberthreat detection capabilities. We implement a 'Adaptive Thresholding with Early Stopping method' based methodology in Federated Learning to systematically train and aggregate local models based on predefined training rounds, thereby ensuring that all local models contribute to the global model until a target accuracy is achieved. This method significantly improves the detection of zero-day attacks by reducing dependency on random selections and partial data. The system architecture features Digital Twins of IoT medical infrastructure components—such as radiology, intensive care, and outpatient care—positioned at the network edge to minimize latency and bandwidth usage. Comparative evaluations of our model against traditional federated averaging methods demonstrate superior performance, with enhancements in model aggregation efficiency evidenced by higher F1 scores and reduced CPU usage. Specifically, our distributed digital twin environment at the edge layer shows 14% and 33% latency reductions compared to fog and cloud-based implementations, respectively. This study highlights the potential of Digital Twin and advanced Federated Learning methodologies to secure IoT networks against evolving and growing cyber threats.

AB  - Years into the insider threat, it remains an universal challenge to predict and defend. Concerning this problem, there has been a multitude of solutions, including the detection of sentiment fluctuations of an entity to predict its abnormality degree. Previous research solely focus on the analysis of individual anomalies, but ignore the sociality of individual sentiments. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an approach to internal threats detection based on sentiment and network analysis. Above all, we use Natural Language ToolKit (NLTK) to analyze the sentiment of each preprocessed email, and thus we establish sentiment communication network. The graphs are reconstructed into series and reshaped as matrices. By the singular value decomposition (SVD), the matrix is decomposed into base networks, and we analyze the change in importance of important base networks over time to detect the company’s internal conditions. When anomalies occur, we establish combination networks which consist of base networks and can represent the abnormal character patterns of this time. Then compare the eigenvector centrality of both combination networks and total network to identify the employees related to this anomaly. The experiment shows that it can locate the anomaly-related employees accurately, and according to the network graph, the top few of anomaly-related employees are associated in group internal threats. Our approach provides the anomaly-related rank of employees and the abnormal character pattern of the sentiment communication network at the moment of anomaly.

AB  - Showing a great potential in various domains, machine learning techniques are more and more used in the task of malicious network traffic detection to significantly enhance the ability of intrusion detection system (IDS). When associating with Software-Defined Networks (SDN), the deployment of IDSs can leverage the centralized control plane in SDN to support for large-scale network monitoring. However, machine learning-based IDSs themselves can be attacked and tricked by adversarial examples with additional perturbation from the original ones. It is vital to provide supplementary unknown traffic to evaluate and improve the resilience of IDS against variants of cyberattacks. Thus, this work explores the method of generating adversarial attack samples by Generative Adversarial Model (GAN) to deceive IDS. We propose DIGFuPAS, a framework can create attack samples which can bypass machine learning-based IDSs in SDN with the black-box manner. In this framework, instead of Vanilla GAN, we use Wassertein GAN (WGAN) to improve the ability of GAN convergence training. In addition, the strategy of preserving functional features of attack traffic is applied to maintain the operational aspect of adversarial attacks. Through our implementation and experiments on NSL-KDD and CICIDS2018 dataset, the decreased detection rate of black-box IDSs on adversarial attacks demonstrates that our proposed framework can make IDSs in SDN-enabled networks misclassify on GAN-based synthetic attacks. Also, we utilize DIGFuPAS as a tool for evaluating and improving the robustness of IDS by repetitively retraining classifiers from crafted network traffic flow.

AB  - Smart cities are rapidly evolving by adopting Internet of Things (IoT) devices, edge and cloud computing, and mobile connectivity. While these advancements enhance urban efficiency and connectivity, they also significantly increase the risk of cyber threats targeting critical infrastructure. Modern interdependent systems require flexible resilience, allowing them to adapt to changing conditions while maintaining core functions. Smart city networks, however, face unique security vulnerabilities due to their scale and heterogeneity. Altered to industry expectations and requirements, traditional security models are generally restrictive. With its "never trust, always verify' motto, the Zero Trust (ZT) security model starkly differs from traditional models. ZT builds on network design by mandating real time identity verification, giving minimum access permission and mandating respect for the principle of least privilege. Software Defined Networking (SDN) extends one step further by offering central control over the network, policy based autonomous application and immediate response to anomalies. To address these challenges, our proposed Trust-based Resilient Edge Networks (TREN) framework integrates ZT principles to enhance smart city security. Under the umbrella of SDN controllers, SPP, the underpinning component of TREN, performs real time trust analysis and autonomous policy enforcement, for instance, applying high level threat defense mechanisms. TREN dynamically defends against advanced threats like DDoS and Sybil attacks by isolating malicious nodes and adapting defense tactics based on real-time trust and traffic analysis. Trust analysis and policy control modules provide dynamic adaptive coverage, permitting effective proactive defense. Mininet-based simulations demonstrate TREN's efficacy, achieving 95 % detection accuracy, a 20 % latency reduction, and a 25 % increase in data throughput when compared to baseline models.

AB  - This paper explores security risks in state estimation based on multi-sensor systems that implement a Kalman filter and a χ2 detector. When measurements are transmitted via wireless networks to a remote estimator, the innovation sequence becomes susceptible to interception and manipulation by adversaries. We consider a class of linear deception attacks, wherein the attacker alters the innovation to degrade estimation accuracy while maintaining stealth against the detector. Given the inherent volatility of the detection function based on the χ2 detector, we propose broadening the traditional feasibility constraint to accommodate a certain degree of deviation from the distribution of the innovation. This broadening enables the design of stealthy attacks that exploit the tolerance inherent in the detection mechanism. The state estimation error is quantified and analyzed by deriving the iteration of the error covariance matrix of the remote estimator under these conditions. The selected degree of deviation is combined with the error covariance to establish the objective function and the attack scheme is acquired by solving an optimization problem. Furthermore, we propose a novel detection algorithm that employs a majority-voting mechanism to determine whether the system is under attack, with decision parameters dynamically adjusted in response to system behavior. This approach enhances sensitivity to stealthy and persistent attacks without increasing the false alarm rate. Simulation results show that the designed leads to about a 41% rise in the trace of error covariance for stable systems and 29% for unstable systems, significantly impairing estimation performance. Concurrently, the proposed detection algorithm enhances the attack detection rate by 33% compared to conventional methods.

AB  - Smart cities represent the future of urban evolution, characterized by the intricate integration of the Internet of Things (IoT). This integration sees everything, from traffic management to waste disposal, governed by interconnected and digitally managed systems. As fascinating as the promise of such cities is, they have its challenges. A significant concern in this digitally connected realm is the introduction of fake clients. These entities, masquerading as legitimate system components, can execute a range of cyber-attacks. This research focuses on the issue of fake clients by devising a detailed simulated smart city model utilizing the Netsim program. Within this simulated environment, multiple sectors collaborate with numerous clients to optimize performance, comfort, and energy conservation. Fake clients, who appear genuine but with malicious intentions, are introduced into this simulation to replicate the real-world challenge. After the simulation is configured, the data flows are captured using Wireshark and saved as a CSV file, differentiating between the real and fake clients. We applied MATLAB machine learning techniques to the captured data set to address the threat these fake clients posed. Various machine learning algorithms were tested, and the k-nearest neighbors (KNN) classifier showed a remarkable detection accuracy of 98 77%. Specifically, our method increased detection accuracy by 4.66%, from 94.02% to 98.68% over three experiments conducted, and enhanced the Area Under the Curve (AUC) by 0.49%, reaching 99.81%. Precision and recall also saw substantial gains, with precision improving by 9.09%, from 88.77% to 97.86%, and recall improving by 9.87%, from 89.23% to 99.10%. The comprehensive analysis underscores the role of preprocessing in enhancing the overall performance, highlighting its superior performance in detecting fake IoT clients in smart city environments compared to conventional approaches. Our research introduces a powerful model for protecting smart cities, merging sophisticated detection techniques with robust defenses.

AB  - Critical infrastructures (CIs) are highly susceptible to cyber threats due to their crucial role in the nation and society. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are deployed at the process level to enhance CI security. These process-level IDSs are broadly categorized into univariate and multivariate systems. Our research underscores that both types of systems encounter limitations, especially in handling correlations among process variables (PVs). Univariate IDSs neglect correlations by assessing PVs in isolation, while multivariate IDSs capture these but are vulnerable to evasion attacks. In response, we introduce ProIDS- a novel segmentation and segregation-based process-level IDS. ProIDS leverages the inherent correlations among PVs while segregating them into distinct units to enhance security against evolving threats. This strategic approach ensures the capture of correlations and mitigates the risk of evasion attacks, enhancing the system’s ability to detect abnormal activities. Additionally, ProIDS offers non-parametric modeling for heightened performance, minimal computational overhead, and noise reduction properties. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate ProIDS’s superiority over baseline methods, delivering precise detection of various attacks while maintaining operational efficiency.

AB  - Aiming to safeguard a decentralized setup such as smart cities, collaborative intrusion detection system (CIDS) has become a mainstream security mechanism to protect different types of computer networks, especially decentralized computing platforms such as Internet of Things (IoT). The main benefit of CIDS relies on the information sharing process among devices, nodes, software and hardware entities. However, traditional CIDS often requires a trusted third partner, e.g., a centralized computing server, to help build up a trusted communication channel among various entities. Such requirement is not practical in real-world implementation, making the integrity of shared information compromised easily. With the wide adoption, blockchain technology has given a solution to protect the distributed/collaborative detection system. In the current market, blockchain technology has been extensively researched across many detection scenarios, but there is a need to explore how such technology can overall contribute to CIDS and a general distributed detection system. In this work, we introduce a blockchain-assisted security management framework for CIDS, which summarizes and provides an integrated protection given by blockchain. In the case study, we evaluate our proposed framework in both a simulated and a real CIDS setup with challenge-based mechanism. The results demonstrate the promising benefits provided by blockchain in CIDS.

AB  - Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been shown vulnerable to Test-Time Evasion attacks (TTEs, or adversarial examples), which, by making small changes to the input, alter the DNN’s decision. We propose an unsupervised attack detector for DNN classifiers based on class-conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). We model the distribution of clean data conditioned on the predicted class label by an Auxiliary Classifier GAN (AC-GAN). Given a test sample and its predicted class, three detection statistics are calculated based on the AC-GAN generator and discriminator. Experiments on image classification datasets under various TTE attacks show that our method outperforms previous detection methods. We also investigate the effectiveness of anomaly detection using different DNN layers (input features or internal-layer features) and demonstrate, as one might expect, that anomalies are harder to detect using features closer to the DNN’s output layer. Finally, our approach is also investigated for more general out-of-distribution detection.

AB  - The increasing sophistication of network attacks, particularly zero-day threats, underscores the need for robust, unsupervised detection methods. These attacks can flood networks with malicious traffic, overwhelm resources, or render services unavailable to legitimate users. Existing machine learning methods for zero-day attack detection typically rely on statistical features of network traffic, such as packet sizes and inter-arrival times. However, traditional approaches that depend on manually labeled data and linear structures often struggle to capture the intricate spatiotemporal correlations crucial for detecting unknown attacks. This paper introduces the Multiscale Temporal Convolutional Recurrent Autoencoder (MTCR-AE), an innovative framework designed to detect malicious network traffic by leveraging Multiscale Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU). The MTCR-AE model captures both short- and long-range spatiotemporal dependencies while incorporating a temporal attention mechanism to dynamically prioritize critical features. The MTCR-AE operates in an unsupervised manner, eliminating the need for manual data labeling and enhancing its scalability for real-world applications. Experimental evaluations conducted on four benchmark datasets — ISCX-IDS-2012, USTC-TFC-2016, CIRA-CIC-DoHBrw2020, and CICIoT2023 — demonstrate the model’s superior performance, achieving an accuracy of 99.69%, precision of 99.63%, recall of 99.69%, and an F1-score of 99.66%. The results highlight the model’s capability to deliver state-of-the-art detection performance while maintaining low false positive and false negative rates, offering a scalable and reliable solution for dynamic network environments.

AB  - Preserving anonymity and confidentiality of transactions has become crucial with widespread of the blockchain technology. Despite of the increased efforts for retaining privacy in blockchain networks, invasion attacks are still surfacing. Most of these attacks do not come from outsiders, but from the resident adversarial nodes. Existence of these insider adversaries lead to damaging of an organization’s internal network system and information leakage. Consequently, transaction anonymity and confidentiality are compromised. Hence, adversary detection and filtration play a vital role in protecting networks against unforeseen privacy and security threats. Therefore, in this paper, we propose RZee, a cryptographic and statistical privacy preserving model for adversary detection and filtering in blockchain networks. Firstly, RZee exploits zero-knowledge proofs to cryptographically secure the data. Secondly, based on certain identified conditions, RZee captures node behavior and blacklists malicious nodes to restrict those from injecting harmful data into the chain or viewing transactions as they propagate across the network. This adds an additional layer of protecting transactions from unauthorized and malicious intervention. The proposed framework is evaluated based on various privacy attributes as identified by literature. For this evaluation, 4 different types of experiments have been conducted. Further, the comparison of privacy perseverance of RZee with existing benchmark privacy-preserving frameworks is also done. The results depict that performance and privacy preservation in RZee exceeds the rest with an attribute score of 6.774 and a gain margin of 46.5%.

AB  - Federated Learning (FL) integrates valuable training data from multiple parties, giving models both commercial value and a high risk of theft. Embedded watermarks are widely used to assert model ownership, yet existing server-centric methods often require auxiliary data comparable in size to client data. This contradicts FL's core principle of data locality and raises privacy compliance concerns around user data collection and storage. Moreover, existing research mainly follows the traditional security assumptions of deep learning, focusing on defending against external attackers, while ignoring the fact that the characteristics of FL make internal attackers a more threatening source of attacks. To address these gaps, we propose FedRPW, a robust and privacy-compliant watermarking framework for FL. FedRPW utilizes secret sharing to partition the server-side watermark into client-specific slices, effectively ensuring privacy compliance. Simultaneously, an RSA mechanism is incorporated to enable verification of the correctness of watermark slices and to defend against ambiguity attacks. Finally, we theoretically demonstrate that the watermark-slice training achieves at least an O(1ϵ) convergence rate, effectively serving as an indicator of free-rider behavior. Experiments confirm that FedRPW remains robust and practical, defending against internal and external threats with less than a 2% drop in model accuracy.

AB  - Bitcoin is a decentralized cryptocurrency, which is rapidly growing and offering many advantages. Although its structure protects users from some types of fraud, it is not completely immune, while fraud detection in Bitcoin remains still relatively unexplored. In this paper, we use a graph to model Bitcoin transactions and benefit from the graph’s structure to overcome the lack of informative transaction and user data. We utilize network analysis for feature extraction and model fraud detection as a classification problem using a Deep Neural Network as our classifier. Furthermore, we propose a novel approach that combines a Variational Graph Autoencoder (VGAE), for deriving appropriate node and graph embeddings, and supervised learning to detect fraudulent Bitcoin transactions. Our experimental results show that the proposed approach, while also affected by high class imbalance, similarly to using only the graph-based features for classification, performs significantly better in detecting high-risk areas in the graph.

KW  - Arrhythmia diagnosis

KW  - Multi-label
KW  - Hybrid residual recurrent convolutional neural network
AB  - Arrhythmia is a prevalent cardiovascular disease that can unveil various heart health issues. In recent times, the rise of wearable devices has garnered attention towards the advantages of portable single-lead ECG devices in heart health monitoring. Achieving end-to-end ECG automatic diagnosis through deep learning is essential due to the time-consuming and labour-intensive characteristics of manual diagnosis of ECG records. This paper presents the design of a hybrid residual recurrent convolutional neural network (HRRCNN) for automatically diagnosing single-lead ECG with multiple labels. Firstly, the convolutional layers and residual networks extract the spatial and short-term temporal features. Subsequently, a hybrid recurrent neural network (RNN) comprised of a double-layer bidirectional gated recurrent unit (GRU) and a bidirectional long short-term memory (LSTM) is employed to capture long and short-term temporal features. Finally, an output layer, comprising an attention layer and a fully connected layer, converts the extracted features into classification results. To evaluate the performance of HRRCNN, a dataset from the Shanghai First People’s Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai JiaoTong University(Shanghai General Hospital, SGH) is utilized. The experimental results demonstrate that HRRCNN achieves an accuracy of 95.08 %, F1-macro of 87.22 %, Sensitivity of 88.51 %, and a positive prediction rate of 86.13 %. Comparative analysis with existing methods underscores the superior performance of HRRCNN, thereby establishing its potential as an out-of-hospital heart health monitoring tool and an auxiliary tool in clinical settings.

AB  - Geopolitical instability is exacerbating the risk of catastrophic cyber-attacks striking where defences are weak. Nevertheless, cyber-attack trend forecasting predominantly relies on human expertise, which is susceptible to subjectivity and potential bias. As a solution, we have recently presented a novel study that harnesses machine learning for long-term cyber-attack forecasting. Building upon this groundwork, our research advances to the next level, by predicting the disparity between cyber-attack trends and the trend of the relevant alleviation technologies. The proposed approach applies key constructs of Protection Motivation Theory while introducing a proactive version of the theory. Our predictive analysis aims to offer strategic insights for the decision of investment in cyber security technologies. It also provides a sound foundation for the strategic decisions of national defence agencies. To achieve this objective, we have expanded our dataset, which now encompasses records spanning 42 distinct cyber-attack types and various related features, alongside data concerning the trends of 98 pertinent technologies, dating back to 2011. The dataset features were meticulously curated from diverse sources, including news articles, blogs, government advisories, as well as from platforms such as Elsevier, Twitter, and Python APIs. With our comprehensive dataset in place, we construct a graph that elucidates the intricate interplay between cyber threats and the development of pertinent alleviation technologies. To forecast the graph, we introduce a novel Bayesian adaptation of a recently proposed graph neural network model, which effectively captures and predicts these trends. We further demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed features in this context. Furthermore, our study extends its horizon by generating future data projections for the next three years, encompassing forecasts for the evolving graph, including predictions of the gap between cyber-attack trends and the trend of the associated technologies. As a consequential outcome of our forecasting efforts, we introduce the concept of “alleviation technologies cycle”, delineating the key phases in the life cycle of 98 technologies. These findings serve as a foundational resource, offering valuable guidance for future investment and strategic defence decisions within the realm of cyber security related technologies.

KW  - continuous-time dynamic graph
KW  - data enhancement
AB  - Lateral movement represents the most covert and critical phase of Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs), and its detection still faces two primary challenges: sample scarcity and “cold start” of new entities. To address these challenges, we propose an Uncertainty-Driven Graph Embedding-Enhanced Lateral Movement Detection framework (UGEA-LMD). First, the framework employs event-level incremental encoding on a continuous-time graph to capture fine-grained behavioral evolution, enabling newly appearing nodes to retain temporal contextual awareness even in the absence of historical interactions and thereby fundamentally mitigating the cold-start problem. Second, in the embedding space, we model the dependency structure among feature dimensions using a Gaussian copula to quantify the uncertainty distribution, and generate augmented samples with consistent structural and semantic properties through adaptive sampling, thus expanding the representation space of sparse samples and enhancing the model's generalization under sparse sample conditions. Unlike static graph methods that cannot model temporal dependencies or data augmentation techniques that depend on predefined structures, UGEA-LMD offers both superior temporal-dynamic modeling and structural generalization. Experimental results on the large-scale LANL log dataset demonstrate that, under the transductive setting, UGEA-LMD achieves an AUC of 0.9254; even when 10% of nodes or edges are withheld during training, UGEA-LMD significantly outperforms baseline methods on metrics such as recall and AUC, confirming its robustness and generalization capability in sparse-sample and cold-start scenarios.

AB  - This work presents results of the International Atomic Energy Agency's Coordinated Research Project (CRP) on Enhancing Computer Security for Radiation Detection Systems. These systems include a wide range of fixed and mobile radiation detectors used in safety and security applications. The signals and data generated by radiation detection systems are transmitted to local or remote monitoring centers through various communication channels, enhancing the effectiveness of threat detection and enabling a timely response to alarm conditions. However, during the generation, processing, transmission and display of this information, data can be compromised. This CRP brought together 11 research institutes from 10 Member States to explore various topics, including threat modeling, cloud computing, malware propagation in large radiation detection networks, intrusion detection systems, defensive computer security architecture, wireless communication security, and simulation of integrated physical protection and radiation detection systems. The participating institutes created a reference architecture, designed models for synthetic radiation data and anomaly detection methods, performed vulnerability assessments of radiation detection systems, and developed prototypes for both virtual and hardware-in-the-loop testbeds. Their research also led to the creation of simulators, including a physical protection–radiation detector simulator that incorporates a 3D hospital model.

AB  - ‘Minority attack detection’ is a matter of great concern while designing a secure network and safeguarding it against cyber criminals who attempt to breach its defenses, intrude into its systems, and gain unauthorized access to sensitive information. An adequate intrusion detection system is demanded to counter such threats involving class imbalance and high dimensionality in network traffic. In this context, an artificial intelligence-based multiclass framework MCGAL is presented, which leverages the evolutionary technique of genetic algorithm to achieve the finest feature selection and stacked long short-term memory (LSTM) for traffic classification. The proposed approach utilizes cost-sensitive LSTM by assigning greater significance to minority or rarely occurring classes, thereby addressing the challenge of misclassification in the presence of imbalanced data in a real web attack subset of the CSE-CIC-IDS2018 dataset. A comprehensive performance analysis is performed to evaluate our proposed scheme concerning various class metrics using weighted and macro averages, which reveals a classification accuracy of 100 %. An achieved weighted average of 1.00 is then compared with baseline classifiers like decision trees, AdaBoost, and support vector machines utilizing both linear and radial kernels. The results of MCGAL are also assessed with recently reported techniques on the same dataset demonstrating remarkable improvements in all metrics such as precision, recall, and F-score of minority class detection. A pair-wise comparison and Kruskal-Wallis test at a 95 % significance level further illustrate the statistical significance of the proposed scheme for minority class detection.

AB  - 6G is envisioned as the next generation of wireless communication technology, promising unprecedented data speeds, ultra-low Latency, and ubiquitous Connectivity. In tandem with these advancements, blockchain technology is leveraged to enhance computer vision applications’ security, trustworthiness, and transparency. With the widespread use of mobile devices equipped with cameras, the ability to capture and recognize Chinese characters in natural scenes has become increasingly important. Blockchain can facilitate privacy-preserving mechanisms in applications where privacy is paramount, such as facial recognition or personal healthcare monitoring. Users can control their visual data and grant or revoke access as needed. Recognizing Chinese characters from images can provide convenience in various aspects of people’s lives. However, traditional Chinese character text recognition methods often need higher accuracy, leading to recognition failures or incorrect character identification. In contrast, computer vision technologies have significantly improved image recognition accuracy. This paper proposed a Secure end-to-end recognition system (SE2ERS) for Chinese characters in natural scenes based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) using 6G technology. The proposed SE2ERS model uses the Weighted Hyperbolic Curve Cryptograph (WHCC) of the secure data transmission in the 6G network with the blockchain model. The data transmission within the computer vision system, with a 6G gradient directional histogram (GDH), is employed for character estimation. With the deployment of WHCC and GDH in the constructed SE2ERS model, secure communication is achieved for the data transmission with the 6G network. The proposed SE2ERS compares the performance of traditional Chinese text recognition methods and data transmission environment with 6G communication. Experimental results demonstrate that SE2ERS achieves an average recognition accuracy of 88% for simple Chinese characters, compared to 81.2% with traditional methods. For complex Chinese characters, the average recognition accuracy improves to 84.4% with our system, compared to 72.8% with traditional methods. Additionally, deploying the WHCC model improves data security with the increased data encryption rate complexity of ∼12 & higher than the traditional techniques.

AB  - Internet of Things (IoT) has become more important for setting up a smart environment, e.g., smart home. It is a network of connected devices, which can provide many benefits such as automating and controlling the tasks on a daily basis without human intervention. While due to the dispersed structure, IoT networks are vulnerable to various attacks, e.g., Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS). To protect such environment, building a suitable collaborative intrusion detection network (CIDN) is essential by enabling the exchange of required data among nodes. In addition, deploying a packet filtration mechanism with CIDN is necessary to reduce unwanted events and traffic. However, how to safeguard the integrity of exchanged information is a challenge, because a malicious internal node can manipulate and deliver untruthful data. Motivated by the blockchain technology, in this work, we develop a blockchain-based filtration mechanism with CIDN to help protect the security of IoT networks by refining unexpected events. In addition, we leverage IPFS technology to host and share information like blacklist. In the evaluation, we examine the filter performance with three real datasets, a simulated environment and a practical environment, respectively. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of our filter compared with similar studies.

AB  - The application of Software-defined Networking (SDN) in low-latency scenarios, such as 6G, has received immense attention. Notably, our research reveals that SDN remains susceptible to link fabrication attacks (LFA) in low-latency environments, where existing detection methods fail to effectively detect LFA. To address this issue, we propose a novel detection method called Correlated Link Verification (CLV). CLV is composed of three phases. Firstly, we introduce a data processing method to mitigate measurement error and enhance robustness. Secondly, we present a multipath transmission simulation method to convert the measured performance disparity between correlated links into statistical features. Thirdly, we propose a dynamic threshold calculation method, which utilizes the statistical features to determine thresholds based on extreme value theory and probability distribution fitting. Finally, CLV identifies the fabricated link within correlated links based on the thresholds and current statistical features. Extensive experiments have been conducted to validate the feasibility, effectiveness, scalability and robustness of CLV. The experimental results demonstrate that CLV can effectively detect LFA in low-latency SDN networks.
