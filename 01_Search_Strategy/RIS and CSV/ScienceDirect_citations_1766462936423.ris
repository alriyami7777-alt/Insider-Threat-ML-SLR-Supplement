AB  - The emerging cloud technology and its integration with cloud services from an enterprise standpoint have provided a gateway for Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) to garner consumers and their data. Due to the growing increase of Cloud Service Users (CSUs), it is pertinent to provide an adequate amount of cloud security to prevent detrimental impacts to businesses. Two large challenges CSPs face for cloud security include transparency and malicious insiders. The primary objective of this work is to provide a framework that analyzes CSPs based on evaluation metrics such as data breaches, data loss, account hijacking, insecure APIs, DoS, malicious insiders, abuse of cloud services, insufficient due diligence, and shared technology concerns. The security index of a CSP is then computed based on the listed evaluation metrics and given a score that translates to a linguistic rating of the CSP. Factors within transparency and malicious insiders are further broken down within the framework to emphasize various components. Transparency factors include published audit certifications, consumer base, membership of cloud organizations, and published incidents. Malicious insiders are sub-sectioned into personnel-related prevention, policy-related prevention, third-party CSP prevention, technical-related prevention, and hypervisor-related prevention. With this scoring contribution, analysis is able to be done on a CSP's potential threats within the network, which can then be visualized into recommended security controls or preventative measures. Finally, we conducted case studies to demonstrate the application of the scoring analysis using our proposed framework and to evaluate the security levels of two extensively employed CSPs.

AB  - In the context of rapidly urbanizing smart cities reliant on IoT networks, efficient load management is critical for sustainable energy use. This paper proposes an AI-enhanced Multi-Stage Learning-to-Learning (MSLL) approach tailored for secure load management in IoT networks. The proposed approach leverages MMStransformer, a transformer-based model designed to handle multivariate, correlated data, and to capture long-range dependencies inherent in load forecasting. MMStransformer employs a multi-mask learning-to-learning strategy, optimizing computational efficiency without compromising prediction accuracy. The study addresses the dynamic and complex nature of smart city data by integrating diverse environmental and operational variables. Security and privacy concerns inherent in IoT networks are also addressed, ensuring secure data handling and communication. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach, achieving competitive performance compared to traditional methods and baseline models. The findings highlight the potential of AI-driven solutions in enhancing load forecasting accuracy while ensuring robust security measures in smart city infrastructures.

AB  - Spatial information networks (SINs) have emerged as a means to enhance the expanse and dependability of communication and data transmission services. SINs rely on satellite systems to provide these services, among which low earth orbit (LEO) satellites are widely concerned because of their advantages of low orbital altitude, small network transmission delay, small path loss, and high signal strength. However, due to the frequent switching of communication links between LEO satellites and the ground, the authentication mechanism of the ground users to the satellites is vulnerable to spoofing attacks, and the traditional upper layer authentication method based on encryption usually requires a lot of overhead and delay. In this case, the lightweight physical layer authentication (PLA) mechanism utilizes the inherent distinctiveness and unpredictable nature of channel physical properties, serving as a vital application in SINs for ensuring authentication. Therefore, our work introduces a PLA method incorporating multi-feature integration, aimed at delivering effective identity verification tailored for LEO satellites. The approach employs doppler frequency shift (DS), angles of arrival (AOAs), and received power (RP) features, fusing an support vector machine (SVM) classifier, to distinguish between legal and illegal satellites in different simulation scenarios. The satellite toolkit (STK) is used to collect data from the actual orbit of satellites and assess the efficacy of the scheme. The findings indicate that the scheme offers enhanced authentication capabilities.

AB  - The classification of mental health conditions using electroencephalogram (EEG) signals has gained increasing attention due to its non-invasive nature and potential for early diagnosis. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) plays a crucial role in enhancing the interpretability of machine learning models; however, traditional XAI methods often suffer from high computational costs and redundant feature selection. In this study, we propose Envolving Explainable Artificial Intelligence (E-XAI), an evolutionary XAI framework that leverages Genetic Algorithms (GA) to efficiently search for the optimal EEG feature subset, reducing computational overhead while maintaining interpretability. Furthermore, this work integrates Digital Twin technology, enabling a dynamic and adaptive representation of EEG-based mental states. The proposed framework allows real-time monitoring, remote diagnosis, and personalized mental health interventions by continuously updating the digital twin model with real-time EEG data. This enhances model adaptability, robustness, and scalability for mental health classification. Experimental results on a benchmark EEG dataset demonstrate that E-XAI with Digital Twin technology significantly reduces the computational time of XAI techniques while improving the classification performance and interpretability of mental health classification systems. This advancement provides a promising pathway for real-time, scalable, and intelligent EEG-based mental health analysis.

AB  - In critical IoT ecosystems, where autonomous devices operate without human oversight, security hinges on robust identity management as the foundation of authentication. Traditional methods struggle to address dynamic threats and scalability demands, creating vulnerabilities in machine-to-machine trust. Self-sovereign identity (SSI) emerges as a transformative paradigm, enabling decentralized, cryptographically assured authentication while ensuring operational resilience. This paper proposes a dual-blockchain framework for IoT authentication, integrating cryptographic identity verification with behavioral trust analytics. The architecture consists of a decentralized identity blockchain for credential issuance and lifecycle management, alongside a transaction blockchain for validating device interactions, both coordinated through smart contracts across trust authorities, devices, and full nodes. The protocol combines static authentication using signed credentials with continuous authentication via a machine learning-enhanced Dirichlet trust model, enabling real-time behavioral anomaly detection. Implemented on Hyperledger family, the framework achieves 92.3% accuracy in detecting behavioral anomalies with only a 7.1% false positive rate, maintaining computational efficiency while resisting forgery and Byzantine attacks.

AB  - The theft and exfiltration of sensitive data (e.g. state secrets, trade secrets, company records, etc.) represent one of the most damaging threats that can be carried by malicious insiders against institutions and organizations. In the last decade, data leak prevention (DLP) has emerged as a new mechanism to detect and block unauthorized data transfer from the organization perimeter. While DLP has gained traction and led to several commercial products in industry, there are still many unresolved challenges hampering its operation and full adoption. Existing DLP systems exhibit relatively limited accuracy and can be circumvented using various evasive tactics. In this paper, we present a new DLP model that tracks sensitive data using a summarized version of the content semantic called document semantic signature (DSS). The DSS can be updated dynamically as the protected content change and it is resilient against evasion tactics, such as content rewriting. The evaluation of the DSS model on a public dataset achieved very encouraging results in terms of detection effectiveness.

AB  - Sophisticated security mechanisms for the integrity, trust, and availability of data in such big data environments have been developed, especially in multi-cloud scenarios. Most of these traditional solutions suffer from latency, energy inefficiency, and unauthorized access. Traditional models for security mostly based on static encryption and proof mechanisms, which are inadequate, result in high data processing delays, high energy consumption, and low throughput. Often, such models are quite unsuccessful in detecting unauthorized access attempts, thereby increasing security risks. In this paper, the authors introduce a new security framework that refers to an IBMESR—an outline of an integrated blockchain model for efficient, scalable, and robust operations in big data environments. In the proposed architecture, state-of-the-art technologies are incorporated that support proof of spatial and temporal trust-based blockchain for secured data storage, grey wolf optimization for efficient blockchain sharding, fully homomorphic encryption for securing data across distributed nodes, physical unclonable functions for inter-node resilient communications, and fuzzy rule-based access control to improve security at large. Empirical evaluations have proven that IBMESR can reduce the inefficiencies and vulnerabilities of existing models by an average of 8.3% in terms of data processing delays, 4.5% in energy consumption, and 2.9% in communication throughput, with improvements in security of 8.5% in terms of attack detection accuracy and access speed of 3.5%. This framework is an innovation in big data security that is explicitly designed to provide a comprehensive solution to problems that exist with current approaches and therefore contributes to more secure, efficient, and robust big data ecosystems.

AB  - User-centric privacy preservation is of paramount importance in the realm of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), where making decisions based on nature of data is crucial. This abstract presents a novel approach to safeguarding user privacy within CPS environments by leveraging user query trends and dataset trends while incorporating the principles of differential privacy. By meticulously analyzing historical query patterns and dataset dynamics, this methodology empowers users to retain control over their sensitive data. The application of differential privacy techniques ensures that individual user information remains confidential while enabling comprehensive data analysis to unveil valuable insights, trends, and changes in data distribution. This approach fosters a dynamic privacy ecosystem where users can interact with CPS systems, query their data, and extract valuable knowledge, all while preserving their personal privacy. As we navigate the evolving landscape of CPS, characterized by increasing interconnectivity and data sharing, this user-centric privacy framework not only guarantees data protection but also ushers in a new era of responsible data-driven decision-making, where privacy and utility coexist harmoniously, ultimately enhancing the trust and confidence of users in the CPS environment.

AB  - APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) actors are highly skilled cyber attackers who employ sophisticated techniques to infiltrate and maintain unauthorized access to a network over an extended period. In the APT lifecycle, lateral movement stands out as a critical stage where intruders escalate privileges and move across the network to expand their control and access to sensitive data. While solutions such as UEBA (User and Entity Behavior Analytics) or graph analysis have been proposed to identify lateral movements, their application in real-world cybersecurity incidents remains impractical in terms of both scalability and performance. This paper introduces LM-Hunter, a new robust and efficient method for identifying stealth adversaries moving laterally through the network at scale. LM-Hunter takes advantage of graphs and Transformers, a specific architecture within NLP (Natural Language Processing), to learn the network dynamics for hunting the most suspicious lateral movements of the users. The method is validated in a real-world cybersecurity incident at a Fortune 500 company, one of the largest corporations in the United States, demonstrating its capability to identify adversarial lateral movements in large enterprise networks. LM-Hunter enhances the threat detection capabilities of Incident Response and Threat Hunting teams in real-world scenarios. The application of the method is facilitated by releasing LM-Hunter as an open-source tool, expanding the arsenal of cybersecurity teams for combating cyber threats.

Simultaneously, involving diverse stakeholders in space operations further amplifies this criticality. Similarly, previous research has identified isolated vulnerabilities in SC and proposed individual solutions to mitigate them. While such studies have provided useful insights, they do not offer a comprehensive analysis of space cyber-attack vectors and a critical evaluation of the effectiveness of mitigation strategies. This study addresses this problem by holistically examining the scope of potential space cyber-attack vectors, encompassing the ground, space, user, cloud, communication channels, and supply chain segments. Furthermore, the study evaluates the effectiveness of legacy security controls and frameworks and outlines SC-vector-aligned counterstrategies and mitigation techniques to tackle the unique SC threats. Based on the analysis, the study proposes future research directions to develop and test advanced technological solutions and regulatory and operational frameworks to establish international standards policies and foster stakeholder collaboration. The study contributes a multi-disciplinary foundation and roadmap that researchers, technology developers, and decision-makers can draw on in shaping a robust and sustainable SC framework.

AB  - Class imbalance problem (CIP) in a dataset is a major challenge that significantly affects the performance of Machine Learning (ML) models resulting in biased predictions. Numerous techniques have been proposed to address CIP, including, but not limited to, Oversampling, Undersampling, and cost-sensitive approaches. Due to its ability to generate synthetic data, oversampling techniques such as the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) are the most widely used methodology by researchers. However, one of SMOTE’s potential disadvantages is that newly created minor samples overlap with major samples. Therefore, the probability of ML models’ biased performance toward major classes increases. Generative adversarial network (GAN) has recently garnered much attention due to their ability to create real samples. However, GAN is hard to train even though it has much potential. Considering these opportunities, this work proposes two novel techniques: GAN-based Oversampling (GBO) and Support Vector Machine-SMOTE-GAN (SSG) to overcome the limitations of the existing approaches. The preliminary results show that SSG and GBO performed better on the nine imbalanced benchmark datasets than several existing SMOTE-based approaches. Additionally, it can be observed that the proposed SSG and GBO methods can accurately classify the minor class with more than 90% accuracy when tested with 20%, 30%, and 40% of the test data. The study also revealed that the minor sample generated by SSG demonstrates Gaussian distributions, which is often difficult to achieve using original SMOTE and SVM-SMOTE.

AB  - Deciding the correct offensive security strategy for safeguarding the electrical physical infrastructures of smart grids is a challenging task. The offensive security training against various cyber-attacks focuses on a multitude of electrical subsystems and measurement systems like the Load Frequency Control(LFC) system. Primarily, the principal challenge is to categorize and parameterize the various possible cyber-attacks on electrical infrastructures. This is done by specifying and selecting cyber-attacks considering various main and subsystem blocks of the power structural system within each area of major installations. In this research investigation, formal modeling of security strategy is proposed using Lambda calculus with both classical and quantum perspectives. Furthermore, using a Quantum Machine Learning (QML) technique, the procedure for correct vulnerability prediction, exploitation, and execution strategy is presented with an approximated likelihood of attack and its mode. The local and non-local interactions are introduced as quantum threats and entanglement threats similar to False Data Injection (FDI) methods to induce the attack and counter-attack events through quantum causality connections. Finally, the Quirk simulator is used to validate the proposed quantum design of offensive and defensive attack models considering scenarios of exogenous and scaling attacks on the LFC systems that support the feasibility of the present research work to address the issue of cyber-attacks on the power system networks.

This study explicitly fills research gaps in the developing economy context such as Ethiopia, where security issues are prevalent and context-specific security strategies and policies are lacking.
Design/methodology/approach
This study used a hypothetical scenario survey involving 292 employees and used partial least squares structural equation modeling with the SmartPLS 4.0 tool for data analysis. The methodology sought to explore the relationship between various rationality-based theories and security countermeasures on employees IS misuse. The authors developed a comprehensive theoretical model to address security challenges.
Findings
The findings revealed that neutralization techniques, excluding condemnation of the condemners, significantly predicted IS misuse. In addition, rational choice based deterrence was found to mediate the relationship between countermeasure awareness and IS misuse. Interestingly, deterrence tends to predict intentional IS misuse to a certain extent, with greater security awareness enhancing its effectiveness, which underlines the crucial influence of awareness on curbing IS misuse.
Research limitations/implications
The results of the study are limited by the geographical focus and cross-sectional nature of the sample and may not be generalizable in all contexts. The study needs to be replicated to examine the model across different geographical and sociocultural contexts. The study’s findings inform implications to practice and theory.
Originality/value
This study explores IS security deviant behavior in a developing economy where context-specific countermeasures are limited. Integrating neutralization and rational choice deterrence theories, this study suggests a new comprehensive IS misuse prediction model. The study emphasizes the pivotal role of enhanced countermeasure awareness in averting IS violations, offering new theory and practice contributions.

AB  - Fog computing (FC) is a networking paradigm where wireless devices known as fog nodes are placed at the edge of the network (close to the Internet of Things (IoT) devices). Fog nodes provide services in lieu of the cloud. Thus, improving the performance of the network and making it attractive to social media-based systems. Security issues are one of the most challenges encountered in FC. In this paper, we propose an anomaly-based Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (IDPS) against Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack in the fog layer. The system uses special nodes known as Intrusion Detection System (IDS) nodes to detect intrusion in the network. They periodically monitor the behavior of the fog nodes in the network. Any deviation from normal network activity is categorized as malicious, and the suspected node is isolated. Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) is added to the system to smooth out the noise that is typically found in social media communications. Our results (with 95% confidence) show that the accuracy of the proposed system increases from 80% to 95% after EWMA is added. Also, with EWMA, the proposed system can detect the intrusion from 0.25–0.5 s seconds faster than that without EWMA. However, it affects the latency of services provided by the fog nodes by at least 0.75–1.3 s. Finally, EWMA has not increased the energy overhead of the system, due to its lightweight.

AB  - Hyperledger Fabric (HLF) is an open-source enterprise-grade permissioned distributed ledger technology (DLT) platform whose use is accelerating and finding its place in the operations of some of the world’s largest enterprises. It is foreseeable that current and future economic transactions channeled through this technology will be under considerable cyber risk. Regretfully, the present state of academic literature that concerns modeling HLF, understanding the mechanisms of cyberattacks on HLF, and their interactions with HLF systems is sorely lacking. Thus, to address this lack of understanding and contribute to the literature, by using Petri Net mathematical formalism to model the transaction flow of HLF, this work examines the HLF behavior in the context of an ongoing cyberattack via simulation. First, a realistic model of HLF is presented and validated by leveraging parameters obtained from a deployed HLF test network. Second, this paper introduces a novel joint model of HLF under a Sybil attack scenario. The simulations of the Sybil attack span two dimensions: the model’s parameters and the HLF network structure the attack involves. The numerical results of the simulations show for the first time in academic literature, at the transaction level, the impact of Sybil attacks on the HLF network performance. As a novel contribution of this work, the simulations illuminate the interplay between the structure of each, the HLF network, and the Sybil attack in the context of the resilience of HLF and the effectiveness of the Sybil attack.

AB  - Adversarial lateral movement via compromised accounts remains difficult to discover via traditional rule-based defenses because it generally lacks explicit indicators of compromise. We propose a behavior-based, unsupervised method of lateral movement detection that makes essential use system role—the functions it performs on the network—to identify anomalous inter-system connections. It is based on the observation that the remote hosts a particular system communicates with over time can be organized into a stable and learnable set of roles, and that the roles of the two hosts on either end of a normal connection determine the dynamics of the processes that support the connection, e.g. authentication of a workstation against a Domain Controller involves an idiosyncratic sequences of processes. If a process is compromised by an attacker and used to facilitate lateral movement, these normal patterns might be disrupted in discernible ways. We use unsupervised learning to cluster systems according to role, and then apply frequent-itemset mining to process sequences to establish regular patterns of communication between systems based on role. Rare process sequences might indicate malicious lateral movement, as might generic connections made to remote hosts with novel roles.

AB  - Routing Protocol for Low Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) is the de-facto routing standard in IoT networks. It enables nodes to collaborate and autonomously build ad-hoc networks modeled by tree-like destination-oriented direct acyclic graphs (DODAG). Despite its widespread usage in industry and healthcare domains, RPL is susceptible to insider attacks. Although the state-of-the-art RPL ensures that only authenticated nodes participate in DODAG, such hard security measures are still inadequate to prevent insider threats. This entails a need to integrate soft security mechanisms to support decision-making. This paper proposes iTRPL, an intelligent and behavior-based framework that incorporates trust to segregate honest and malicious nodes within a DODAG. It also leverages multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to make autonomous decisions concerning the DODAG. The framework enables a parent node to compute the trust for its child and decide if the latter can join the DODAG. It tracks the behavior of the child node, updates the trust, computes the rewards (or penalties), and shares them with the root. The root aggregates the rewards/penalties of all nodes, computes the overall return, and decides via its ϵ-Greedy MARL module if the DODAG will be retained or modified for the future. A simulation-based performance evaluation demonstrates that iTRPL learns to make optimal decisions with time.

AB  - Public safety and security authorities utilize tactical mobile networks to enable communications in situations where fixed infrastructure is unavailable. While these rapidly deployable networks rely on open standards, and support emerging applications and cross-organization federation, they are also vulnerable for cyber and insider threats. Active cybersecurity and threat detection solutions must work in isolated tactical bubbles without human interactions and cannot assume connectivity to remote security operations centers. This study explores the concept of a tactical security operations center (T-SOC) and presents an approach to adapting mobile network applications based on security monitoring and analytics. The security-driven prioritization of traffic flows demonstrates, first, a security decision making that is based on traffic analysis and security posture assessment and, second, an intelligent security response to availability threats by dynamically adjusting quality parameters of live video streams. We describe field trialed implementations based on open-source components and measure and analyze trade-offs between edge and cloud-based deployments. We also discuss other potential reaction strategies, such as trust-based routing, and present directions for future research.

AB  - Federated learning (FL) as a novel paradigm in Artificial Intelligence (AI), ensures enhanced privacy by eliminating data centralization and brings learning directly to the edge of the user's device. Nevertheless, new privacy issues have been raised particularly during training and the exchange of parameters between servers and clients. While several privacy-preserving FL solutions have been developed to mitigate potential breaches in FL architectures, their integration poses its own set of challenges. Incorporating these privacy-preserving mechanisms into FL at the edge computing level can increase both communication and computational overheads, which may, in turn, compromise data utility and learning performance metrics. This paper provides a systematic literature review on essential methods and metrics to support the most appropriate trade-offs between FL privacy and other performance-related application requirements such as accuracy, loss, convergence time, utility, communication, and computation overhead. We aim to provide an extensive overview of recent privacy-preserving mechanisms in FL used across various applications, placing a particular focus on quantitative privacy assessment approaches in FL and the necessity of achieving a balance between privacy and the other requirements of real-world FL applications. This review collects, classifies, and discusses relevant papers in a structured manner, emphasizing challenges, open issues, and promising research directions.

AB  - Industrial networks, and more particularly, industrial control systems (ICSs) and industrial Internet of things (IIoT), are no longer isolated environments. The rapid increase of functional needs in Industry 4.0 has indeed exposed them to numerous cyberattacks. Cyberattacks against ICSs or IIoT can cause considerable societal and economic disruption. Cyber resilient and cybersecurity practices are essential to integrate secure networks, control systems, physical processes, and their interconnections toward handling cyberattacks. In this paper, we survey relevant cyber resilience strategies for industrial networks, focusing on ICSs and IIoT. First, we provide a coverage of resilient networks and the fundamental components of ICSs and IIoT. Second, state of the art articles that propose cyber resilience assessment frameworks are reviewed. They are classified according to the resilience aspects they address and the defense mechanism, anomaly detection, failure management and survivability strategy, as well as resilience measure they present. As a result, the main technical and human related challenges, practical limitations, and current cyber resilience needs of industrial networks are identified. Finally, we establish the principal requirements that cyber resilience schemes for industrial networks should meet shortly and suggest promising directions for future research.

AB  - Proactive cyber-risk assessment is gaining momentum due to the wide range of sectors that can benefit from the prevention of cyber-incidents by preserving integrity, confidentiality, and the availability of data. The rising attention to cybersecurity also results from the increasing connectivity of cyber–physical systems, which generates multiple sources of uncertainty about emerging cyber-vulnerabilities. This work introduces a robust statistical framework for quantitative and qualitative reasoning under uncertainty about cyber-vulnerabilities and their prioritisation. Specifically, we take advantage of mid-quantile regression to deal with ordinal risk assessments, and we compare it to current alternatives for cyber-risk ranking and graded responses. For this purpose, we identify a novel accuracy measure suited for rank invariance under partial knowledge of the whole set of existing vulnerabilities. The model is tested on both simulated and real data from selected databases that support the evaluation, exploitation, or response to cyber-vulnerabilities in realistic contexts. Such datasets allow us to compare multiple models and accuracy measures, discussing the implications of partial knowledge about cyber-vulnerabilities on threat intelligence and decision-making in operational scenarios.

AB  - This paper introduces a novel cyberattack vector called the ”Autonomous Firmware Zombie Attack.” Unlike traditional zombie attacks that rely on botnets and direct network control, this method enables attackers to covertly modify the firmware of substation Intelligent Electronic Devices (IEDs) and other firmware-based appliances, including critical industrial equipment, without requiring an active network connection, leaving minimal trace and making an offensive attack with only one infected device instead of a set of multiple devices in botnets. Unlike conventional cyber threats, this method allows attackers to manipulate devices to cause substantial damage while leaving minimal trace, thus evading traditional detection techniques. This study demonstrates the potential of the Autonomous Firmware Zombie Attack (AFZA), which causes substantial damage while evading conventional detection techniques. We first run such an attack on a series of IEDs as proof of concept for this issue. Then, we compare this approach to traditional remote control attacks, highlighting its unique advantages and implications for industrial control system security. This research underscores the critical need for a robust cybersecurity framework tailored to industrial control systems and advances our understanding of the complex risk landscape threatening critical infrastructures.

AB  - Assessing cybersecurity policies is crucial for any organization to combat evolving cyber threats. The absence of a comprehensive dataset has prevented previous studies from analyzing the risk of organizations’ cybersecurity policies. Past studies have not considered temporal information in the policies. Analysis of cybersecurity policies using attention mechanism requires automated determination of optimal number of attention units which remains unaddressed. Moreover, absence of interpretation in cybersecurity studies creates a barrier to understanding policy vulnerabilities and developing targeted solutions. To address these challenges, we develop a decision support system which (i) enhances risk classification of organization’s cybersecurity policies, (ii) develops a comprehensive cybersecurity policy dataset from the websites of 190 companies, transformed into a knowledge graph to capture entity relationships among various policies, (iii) integrates temporal information into the knowledge graph by incorporating time stamps from event sequences in cyberattack information, (iv) develops Explainable Factor Analysis based Multi-Head Attention mechanism, which automates the determination of the optimal number of attention units and optimizes data allocation across attention units using factor analysis, and (v) utilizes attention heatmaps and shapley values for interpretability. Our cybersecurity policy dataset is used as a case study with four benchmark datasets for further validation. Results reveal that our model outperforms the other state-of-the-art, achieving an 87.78% F1 score, followed by robustness checking and statistical significance testing. Finally, Shapley values are used to interpret the model’s output to identify vulnerabilities within the organizational policies, providing crucial insights enabling decision-makers to enhance their cybersecurity policies and mitigate potential threats.

To effectively address the challenges facing SG systems, particularly the secure integration of heterogeneous technologies, and to ensure long-term security, a collaborative framework is established. This framework involves key stakeholders in cybersecurity policies, business strategies, innovative technologies, and public participation. Further development trends and research ideas regarding each factor are discussed. Partnership among the stakeholders is emphasized to ensure the industry's future sustainability and long-term security. This study offers significant value to academics and practitioners by offering a comprehensive review of SGCS development, insights to guide future research, and a collaborative approach that can inform decision-making and promote enduring security strategies.

AB  - Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) have emerged as a transformative technology across multiple domains, including military, logistics, agriculture, and topography. However, limited attention to security during system design, combined with evolving threats and expanding attack surfaces, continues to expose UAS to significant cyber risks. Ensuring the secure operation of these systems is critical, as vulnerabilities can compromise mission success, system integrity, and public safety. To address these challenges, threat modeling is widely regarded as a fundamental practice in system security engineering. Nevertheless, the absence of methodologies explicitly developed for UAS has led practitioners to adopt approaches originally designed for IT systems. These methodologies often fail to account for the distinctive characteristics of UAS as Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), thereby limiting their effectiveness. To bridge this gap, this study introduces the Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis for Drones (PASTAD), a threat modeling methodology adapted from the PASTA framework and tailored to UAS. Built upon a layered architectural model and robust risk assessment metrics, PASTAD provides a structured, systematic, and context-aware process for identifying threats, evaluating risks, and guiding risk mitigation strategies. The methodology is demonstrated through an illustrative case study involving a fixed-wing UAS deployed in airport surveillance. This study further evaluates PASTAD, discusses its scalability and potential generalization across other UAS platforms, and outlines future directions to advance threat modeling practices and strengthen the resilience of these systems in critical applications.

The volume of digital data in general and security event data in specific is increasing exponentially. The velocity with which security event data is generated and fed into a BDCA system is unpredictable. Therefore, a BDCA system should be highly scalable to deal with the unpredictable increase/decrease in the velocity of security event data. However, there has been little effort to investigate the scalability of BDCA systems to identify and exploit the sources of scalability improvement. In this paper, we first investigate the scalability of a Spark-based BDCA system with default Spark settings. We then identify Spark configuration parameters (e.g., execution memory) that can significantly impact the scalability of a BDCA system. Based on the identified parameters, we finally propose a parameter-driven adaptation approach, SCALER, for optimizing a system's scalability. We have conducted a set of experiments by implementing a Spark-based BDCA system on a large-scale OpenStack cluster. We ran our experiments with four security datasets. We have found that (i) a BDCA system with default settings of Spark configuration parameters deviates from ideal scalability by 59.5% (ii) 9 out of 11 studied Spark configuration parameters significantly impact scalability and (iii) SCALER improves the BDCA system's scalability by 20.8% compared to the scalability with default Spark parameter setting. The findings of our study highlight the importance of exploring the parameter space of the underlying big data framework (e.g., Apache Spark) for scalable cyber security analytics.

AB  - Nowadays cyber-attacks keep threatening global networks and information infrastructures. Day-by-day, the threat is gradually getting more destructive and harder to counter, as the global networks continue to enlarge exponentially with limited security counter-measures. This occurrence urgently demands more sophisticated methods and techniques, such as multi-factor authentication and soft biometrics to respond to evolving threats. This paper is concerned with behavioural soft biometrics and proposes a multidisciplinary remote cognitive observation technique to meet today’s cybersecurity needs. The proposed method introduces a non-traditional “cognitive psychology” and “artificial intelligence” based approach. According to contemporary cognitive psychology research, human cognitive processes can be affected by many different personal factors and emotional states which are specific to an individual. Those factors mainly include personal perception, memory, decision-making, reasoning, learning, etc. In this study we focus on visual (graphical) perception with the support of graphical stimuli environments and investigate how such personal cognitive factors can be exploited within the cybersecurity area for remote user authentication. This technique enables remote access to the cognitive behavioural parameters of an intruder/hacker without any physical contact via online connection, disregarding the distance of the threat. The results show that cognitive stimuli provide crucial information for a behavioural user authentication system to classify the user as “authentic” or “intruder”. The ultimate goal of this work is to develop a supplementary cognitive cyber security tool for “next generation” secure online banking, finance or trade systems.

AB  - Smart agriculture modifies traditional farming practices, and offers innovative approaches to boost production and sustainability by leveraging contemporary technologies. In today’s world where technology is everything, these technologies are utilized to streamline regular tasks and procedures in agriculture, one of the largest and most significant industries in every nation. This research paper stands out from existing literature on smart agriculture security by providing a comprehensive analysis and examination of security issues within smart agriculture systems. Divided into three main sections—security analysis, system architecture and design and risk assessment of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) applications—the study delves into various elements crucial for smart farming, such as data sources, infrastructure components, communication protocols, and the roles of different stakeholders such as farmers, agricultural scientists and researchers, technology providers, government agencies, consumers and many others. In contrast to earlier research, this work analyzes the resilience of smart agriculture systems using approaches such as threat modeling, penetration testing, and vulnerability assessments. Important discoveries highlight the concerns connected to unsecured communication protocols, possible threats from malevolent actors, and vulnerabilities in IoT devices. Furthermore, the study suggests enhancements for CPS applications, such as strong access controls, intrusion detection systems, and encryption protocols. In addition, risk assessment techniques are applied to prioritize mitigation tactics and detect potential hazards, addressing issues like data breaches, system outages, and automated farming process sabotage. The research sets itself apart even more by presenting a prototype CPS application that makes use of a digital temperature sensor. This application was first created using a Tinkercad simulator and then using actual hardware with Arduino boards. The CPS application’s defenses against potential threats and vulnerabilities are strengthened by this integrated approach, which distinguishes this research for its depth and usefulness in the field of smart agriculture security.

AB  - With the integration of informatization and intelligence into the Communication-Based Train Control (CBTC) systems, the system is facing an increasing number of information security threats. As an important method of characterizing the system security status, the security situation assessment is used to analyze the system security situation. However, existing situation assessment methods fail to integrate the coupling relationship between the physical layer and the information layer of the CBTC systems, and cannot dynamically characterize the real-time security situation changes under cyber attacks. In this paper, a hierarchical security situation assessment approach is proposed to address the security challenges of CBTC systems, which can perceive cyber attacks, quantify the security situation, and characterize the security situation changes under cyber attacks. Specifically, for the physical layer of CBTC systems, the impact of cyber attacks is evaluated with the train punctuality rate and train departure interval indicators. For the information layer of CBTC systems, the system vulnerabilities and system threats are selected as static level indicators, and the critical network characteristics are selected as dynamic level indicators to quantify the real-time security situation. Finally, the comprehensive security situation assessment value of the CBTC systems is obtained by integrating the physical and information layer indicators. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed approach can dynamically characterize the real-time security situation of CBTC systems, enhancing the ability to perceive and assess information security risks.

AB  - Federated learning (FL) is a critical technology for implementing time-critical computing systems in the Internet of Things (IoT). It allows for continuous updates to machine learning (ML) models across IoT devices. However, the vulnerability of ML models and the complexity of IoT pose significant threats to device data security and privacy, affecting the robustness of time-critical computing systems constructed through FL. Recent research on FL data protection has made progress, but challenges remain in balancing privacy protection with model availability. For example, cryptography-based defense schemes increase time overhead in time-critical computing systems, while differential privacy negatively impacts system performance. This paper proposes the FL properties modification scheme (FLPM) for data preprocessing to resist property inference attacks and data poisoning attacks. FLPM modifies training data properties using algorithms for property separation, selection, and control based on continuous latent variables. While this sacrifices a small amount of classification accuracy, it significantly improves data protection capabilities. Detailed experimental results demonstrate that FLPM successfully separates and controls image property vectors. In the FL classification task, the property modification data achieve a precision of 94.44%. This scheme effectively prevents property inference attacks and data poisoning attacks. FLPM can reduce the AUC score for property inference attacks from 0.94 to 0.56 and reduce the success rate of data poisoning attacks to 5.13%, 7.07%, and 4.60%.

AB  - The growing demand for privacy-preserving healthcare analytics necessitates solutions that comply with global regulatory standards such as HIPAA and GDPR while maintaining high diagnostic accuracy. This paper introduces Health-FedNet, a federated learning (FL) framework designed for secure, decentralized model training across multiple healthcare institutions without transferring raw patient data. Health-FedNet integrates Differential Privacy (DP), Homomorphic Encryption (HE), and an Adaptive Node Weighting Mechanism to enhance privacy, scalability, and robustness against heterogeneous data distributions. Evaluated on the MIMIC-III clinical database, Health-FedNet achieved a 12 % increase in diagnostic accuracy compared to centralized models, with statistical significance confirmed through a Wilcoxon signed-rank test (p < 0.01). The adaptive weighting mechanism prioritizes high-quality data sources, ensuring robust learning and model convergence. Furthermore, Health-FedNet supports real-time streaming updates, optimizing communication overhead and latency, making it suitable for time-sensitive clinical scenarios. Encryption mechanisms are designed to maintain privacy during transmission, aligning with international data protection standards. Future work will explore cross-border scalability, multi-institutional real-time synchronization, and edge-based streaming analytics to further enhance global healthcare collaborations. Health-FedNet represents a scalable, privacy-focused solution for modern healthcare analytics, advancing secure and efficient federated learning in clinical settings.

AB  - Background
Cyber defense is reactive and slow. On average, the time-to-remedy is hundreds of times larger than the time-to-compromise. In response, Human Digital Twins (HDTs) offer the capability of running massive simulations across multiple domains on the Metaverse. Simulated results may predict adversaries' behaviors and tactics, leading to more proactive cyber defense strategies. However, current HDTs’ cognitive architectures are underdeveloped for such use.
Objective
This paper aims to make a case for extending the current digital cognitive architectures as the first step toward more robust HDTs that are suitable for realistic Metaverse cybersecurity simulations.
Methods
This study formally documented 108 psychology constructs and thousands of related paths based on 20 time-tested psychology theories, all of which were packaged as Cybonto—a novel ontology. Then, this study applied 20 network science centrality algorithms in ranking the Cybonto psychology constructs by their influences.
Results
Out of 108 psychology constructs, the top 10 are Behavior, Arousal, Goals, Perception, Self-efficacy, Circumstances, Evaluating, Behavior-Controllability, Knowledge, and Intentional Modality. In this list, only Behaviors, Goals, Perception, Evaluating, and Knowledge are parts of existing digital cognitive architectures. Notably, some of the constructs are not explicitly implemented. Early usability tests demonstrate that Cybonto can also be useful for immediate uses such as manual analysis of hackers’ behaviors and automatic analysis of behavioral cybersecurity knowledge texts.
Conclusions
The results call for specific extensions of current digital cognitive architectures such as explicitly implementing more refined structures of Long-term Memory and Perception, placing a stronger focus on noncognitive yet influential constructs such as Arousal, and creating new capabilities for simulating, reasoning about, and selecting circumstances.

AB  - The healthcare sector holds valuable and sensitive data. The amount of this data and the need to handle, exchange, and protect it, has been increasing at a fast pace. Due to their nature, software-defined networks (SDNs) are widely used in healthcare systems, as they ensure effective resource utilization, safety, great network management, and monitoring. In this sector, due to the value of the data, SDNs face a major challenge posed by a wide range of attacks, such as distributed denial of service (DDoS) and probe attacks. These attacks reduce network performance, causing the degradation of different key performance indicators (KPIs) or, in the worst cases, a network failure which can threaten human lives. This can be significant, especially with the current expansion of portable healthcare that supports mobile and wireless devices for what is called mobile health, or m-health. In this study, we examine the effectiveness of using SDNs for defense against DDoS, as well as their effects on different network KPIs under various scenarios. We propose a threshold-based DDoS classifier (TBDC) technique to classify DDoS attacks in healthcare SDNs, aiming to block traffic considered a hazard in the form of a DDoS attack. We then evaluate the accuracy and performance of the proposed TBDC approach. Our technique shows outstanding performance, increasing the mean throughput by 190.3%, reducing the mean delay by 95%, and reducing packet loss by 99.7% relative to normal, with DDoS attack traffic.

AB  - Nowadays, the technologies in computer vision (CV) are labor-saving and convenient to identify human malicious behaviors. However, they usually fail to consider the robustness, generalization and interpretability of calculation frameworks. In this paper, a very common but sometimes difficult-to-detect case research called armed boundary sabotage is conducted, which is achieved by computer vision module (CVM) and reasoning module (RM). Among them, CVM is used for extracting the key information from raw videos, while RM is applied to obtain the final reasoning results. Considering the transient and confusing properties in such scenarios, a specific human-object interaction analysis process with soft constraint is proposed in CVM. In addition, two reasoning methods which are data-based reasoning method and language-based reasoning methods are implemented in RM. The results show that the human-object interaction analysis process with soft constraint prove to be effective and practical, while the optimal testing accuracy achieves 0.7871. Furthermore, the two proposed reasoning methods are promising for identification of human malicious behaviors. Among them, the advanced language-based reasoning method outperforms others, with highest precision value of 0.8750 and perfect recall value of 1.0000. Besides, these proposals are also verified to be high-performance in other external intrusion scenarios of our previous work. Finally, our research also obtain state-of-the-art results by comparing with other related works.

AB  - The spread of broadband Internet and the availability of mobile communication services expand access to digital services for businesses and the public alike. However, at the same time, it aggravates the problem of ensuring digital space security, protection against cyber threats, and the fight against cybercrime. This research aims to calculate the index of a country's resilience to cyber-hacking for 143 countries, to divide these countries into groups based on this resilience (high, above-average, average, below-average, and low), compare these results with those obtained on the basis of National Cyber Security Index (NCSI), and to identify the impact of the Internet and mobile communication prevalence in a country on this level. The selection of the countries is based on the availability of statistical data for 2022 in the databases of the Surfshark VPN service, and the International Telecommunication Union. The integral index of a country's resilience to cyber-hacking is calculated through the multiplicative convolution (with weighted geometric mean) of the number of breached accounts, the Internet penetration probability (penetration into users’ data through the Internet), and the breach density per thousand users. The influence of active mobile broadband subscriptions (per 100 inhabitants), mobile broadband basket (% of Gross National Income Per Capita), mobile cellular subscriptions (per 100 inhabitants), and total fixed broadband subscriptions on the integral index of a country's resilience to cyber-hacking is investigated using multivariate adaptive regression spline. According to the calculations, France, Iceland, Montenegro, the United States, and the United Arab Emirates were the least resistant to cyber hacking in 2022. For countries with high, above-average, and below-average levels of resilience to cyber-hacking, the most relevant factor is the number of active mobile broadband subscriptions (per 100 inhabitants). For countries with an average level, it is total fixed broadband subscriptions.

AB  - In an age where global connectivity has become pivotal to socio-economic development, satellite communication (SATCOM) systems have become the backbone of modern telecommunication infrastructure. However, the increasing reliance on SATCOM also elevates the potential impact of cyber threats. Cyber risk assessment is a critical component of any satellite communications risk management strategy. It plays a pivotal role in identifying and managing risks to satellite communications, which helps stakeholders isolate the most critical threats and select the appropriate cybersecurity measures. To the best of our knowledge, the field of satellite communications lacks an established framework for cyber risk assessment. Moreover, previous research work has focused only on a limited number of security threats and categories. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a comprehensive risk assessment methodology to qualitatively assess the risk associated with satellite communications cyber threats, following the NIST special publication 800-30: Guide for Conducting Risk Assessments. We analyze existing literature and real-world scenarios to identify potential satellite communications cyber threats and employ the STRIDE threat model for threat modeling. We validate the proposed methodology by performing a risk assessment for the cyber threats identified. Finally, we discuss existing challenges and open research problems for satellite communications cyber risk assessment.

AB  - Most processing facilities, including those in the chemical, petrochemical, and mineral industries, aim to operate as cyber-physical systems to achieve higher plant efficiency, productivity, and, in some cases, safety. However, this digital transformation increases the vulnerability of process control systems to cyber-attacks, which can disrupt operations and lead to catastrophic consequences. Traditional approaches often consider cybersecurity solely as an Information Technology (IT) issue, overlooking the critical role of Operational Technology (OT) in managing cyber threats and ensuring plant resilience. This article reviews OT cybersecurity challenges and solutions, culminating in developing a robust OT-specific cybersecurity framework. The proposed framework integrates threat modeling, real-time attack detection, and real-time mitigation to protect physical plant operations while ensuring operational continuity. Unlike existing models, the proposed framework bridges the safety-security gap by combining IT-driven cybersecurity strategies with OT-specific risk management and defense mechanisms. Key features of the framework include layered defense mechanisms, adaptive response strategies, and risk-based prioritization, all of which collectively strengthen resilience against advanced cyber threats. By systematically reviewing current cybersecurity practices and proposing a comprehensive framework, this study further recommends approaches to enhance scalability and practical applicability for advancing cybersecurity in process plant operations. The findings underscore the necessity of integrating IT and OT cybersecurity strategies to ensure industrial safety, security, and uninterrupted operations.

AB  - With the extensive applicability of machine learning classification algorithms to a wide spectrum of domains, feature selection (FS) becomes a relevant data preprocessing technique due to the high dimensionality of data used in these domains. While efforts have been made to study various filters for ranking features, scholars have paid little attention to developing a unified framework that can be used as an interface for any filter. The development of such a framework would formalize the understanding of filter-based FS. This helps put scholars in the same perspective when analyzing new FS algorithms. This study proposes a new filter-based FS framework based on the best–worst multi-attribute decision-making method. The proposed algorithm is compared to two control groups: (a) no FS and (b) randomized algorithm. Furthermore, two blocking variables are considered: (i) classifier and (ii) training dataset. The performance of the classifiers was measured using the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve. A three-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) is used to compare the proposed approach to the control groups considering the blocking variables. This paper offers several contributions to the literature. For one thing, it is one of the few works that put forward a framework for performing filter-based FS. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, the study is the first to provide empirical evidence about the interaction between the factors considered in the literature for evaluating FS algorithms.

AB  - The Internet of Vehicles (IOV) is a distributed network that provides several services based on vehicle information (e.g., location, speed), such as Electronic Toll Collection (ETC). ETC has been introduced to replace traditional toll booths, where vehicles need to line up to pay, especially during peak travel times. The main advantage of ETC is improved traffic efficiency. However, existing ETC systems often fail to secure the privacy of vehicle information and are vulnerable to fund theft. This makes automatic payments inefficient and susceptible to attacks like the Reentrancy attack. In this paper, we leverage the Ethereum blockchain and smart contracts to facilitate automatic payments within the ETC system. The primary challenges addressed include authenticating vehicle data, automatically deducting fees from users’ wallets, and safeguarding against Reentrancy attacks in smart contracts, all while maintaining the confidentiality of distance-related information necessary for fee calculation. To address these concerns, we implement a decentralized application featuring a comprehensive end-to-end verification algorithm that operates at both entry and exit toll points, incorporating robust measures to protect sensitive distance data from potential leaks. Results show that the accuracy of fees remains relatively high, with reasonable execution times. Additionally, our system’s gas consumption is more efficient compared to related works, making transactions more cost-effective. These outcomes demonstrate that the proposed system not only secures transactions but also ensures correct and efficient payment services, positioning it as a viable solution for improving the security and functionality of ETC systems.

AB  - Healthcare is no exception to the requirement of cutting-edge solutions for healthcare data security and privacy: novel strategies need be formulated on a regular basis given contemporary threat in order to reliable shield over sensitive information. We therefore introduce in this paper a novel technique to increase the data security and privacy of cloud-based healthcare systems. We employ state-of-the-art encryption mechanisms such as Spectrasafe Algorithm, Facile Hash Algorithm and Dynamic k-anonymity (DKA Algorithm) to protect healthcare data at rest and during transit. Conducting a series of performance comparisons, using this high-quality data meticulously prepared from Kaggle to compare it with existing methods SMPC (Secure Multi-Party Computation), MSHC (Multi Server Homomorphic Encryption), AHC-ASS (Attribute-Hiding Cryptography with Attribute-Based Secret Sharing), MP-FHE（Multiparty Fully Homomorphic Encryption). Our encryption and decryption runtime are intensive computationally, with an average runtime of 99 ms and 108 ms, respectively. In terms of memory size our approach is 25 % smaller than existing state-of-the-art methods which indicates that it has a higher efficiency. Our method attains a detection accuracy of 95 %, which is also significant than results of previous methods. Moreover, the proposed method is shown to scale across a wide variety of healthcare datasets and updated requirements seen in modern healthcare systems. We intend to make a significant contribution towards secure and efficient healthcare data management in cloud environments, by extending the proposed privacy preservation mechanisms.

AB  - Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are widely used in both civilian and military applications, operating individually or collaboratively in swarms to enhance coverage, adaptability, and fault tolerance. However, UAV swarms are increasingly exposed to internal, external, or combined disruptions, highlighting the need for robust resilience strategies to ensure mission success. This study presents a literature review on UAV swarm resilience, focusing on swarm control mechanisms, disruption sources, recovery strategies, and evaluation methods. A bibliometric analysis was conducted to reveal academic trends and define the current research scope. Most recent studies approach resilience from the perspective of the swarm itself, often overlooking its broader role in system-level resilience. The reviewed literature also reveals a growing diversity of enhancement approaches and increasing complexity in resilience assessment. These findings underscore the need for continued investigation and standardization, particularly in aligning recovery strategies with disruption types and advancing evaluation frameworks for UAV swarm resilience.

AB  - With cloud computing is being widely adopted in conducting genome-wide association studies (GWAS), how to verify the integrity of outsourced GWAS computation remains to be accomplished. Here, we propose two novel algorithms to generate synthetic SNPs that are indistinguishable from real SNPs. The first method creates synthetic SNPs based on the phenotype vector, while the second approach creates synthetic SNPs based on real SNPs that are most similar to the phenotype vector. The time complexity of the first approach and the second approach is Om and Omlogn2, respectively, where m is the number of subjects while n is the number of SNPs. Furthermore, through a game theoretic analysis, we demonstrate that it is possible to incentivize honest behavior by the server by coupling appropriate payoffs with randomized verification. We conduct extensive experiments of our proposed methods, and the results show that beyond a formal adversarial model, when only a few synthetic SNPs are generated and mixed into the real data they cannot be distinguished from the real SNPs even by a variety of predictive machine learning models. We demonstrate that the proposed approach can ensure that logistic regression for GWAS can be outsourced in an efficient and trustworthy way.

AB  - Many researchers have studied non-expert users’ perspectives of cyber security and privacy aspects of computing devices at home, but their studies are mostly small-scale empirical studies based on online surveys and interviews and limited to one or a few specific types of devices, such as smart speakers. This paper reports our work on an online social media analysis of a large-scale Twitter dataset, covering cyber security and privacy aspects of many different types of computing devices discussed by non-expert users in the real world. We developed two new machine learning based classifiers to automatically create the Twitter dataset with 435,207 tweets posted by 337,604 non-expert users in January and February of 2019, 2020 and 2021. We analyzed the dataset using both quantitative (topic modeling and sentiment analysis) and qualitative analysis methods, leading to various previously unknown findings. For instance, we observed a sharp (more than doubled) increase of non-expert users’ tweets on cyber security and privacy during the pandemic in 2021, compare to in the pre-COVID years (2019 and 2020). Our analysis revealed a diverse range of topics discussed by non-expert users, including VPNs, Wi-Fi, smartphones, laptops, smart home devices, financial security, help-seeking, and roles of different stakeholders. Overall negative sentiment was observed across almost all topics in all the three years. Our results indicate the multi-faceted nature of non-expert users’ perspectives on cyber security and privacy and call for more holistic, comprehensive and nuanced research on their perspectives.

AB  - The emergence of sixth-generation (6 G) wireless networks introduces transformative capabilities such as ultra-low latency, massive device connectivity, and real-time intelligent services. However, the inherently distributed and heterogeneous architecture of 6 G significantly escalates vulnerabilities to cyber threats, unauthorized access, and data breaches across large-scale decentralized infrastructures. Existing security mechanisms are inadequate in modeling complex multi-relational interactions among network entities and often fail to ensure trust, transparency, and tamper-resistance at scale. To address these challenges, this research proposes a novel Blockchain-Enabled 6 G Wireless Network Security framework integrating Multi-Relational Graph Attention and Disentangled Cascaded Graph Convolution Network (Multi-RACG) model. This hybrid graph-based model captures high-order relational dependencies while disentangling semantic features across graph channels to enable precise, context-aware intrusion detection. A Dandelion Optimization Algorithm (DOA) is employed to fine-tune model parameters and optimize network architecture, ensuring rapid convergence and reduced computational overhead. Additionally, a Proof-of-Work-Based Weighted Mining (PoWBWM) consensus protocol strengthens blockchain operations by incorporating dynamic trust metrics, enhancing data integrity and resilience against malicious manipulation. Experimental results demonstrate the framework's superiority, achieving 99.9 % detection accuracy with minimal false positives and computational loss, positioning it as a highly scalable and intelligent security solution for future 6 G ecosystems.

Recent incidents underscore the urgency of addressing these issues. This comprehensive survey investigates the implications of GenAI integration in workplaces, focusing on its impact on organizational operations and security. We analyze vulnerabilities within GenAI systems, threats they face, and repercussions of AI-driven workplace monitoring. By examining diverse attack vectors like model attacks and automated cyberattacks, we expose their potential to undermine data integrity and privacy. Unlike previous works, this survey specifically focuses on the security and privacy implications of GenAI within workplace settings, addressing issues like employee monitoring, deepfakes, and regulatory compliance. We delve into emerging threats during model training and usage phases, proposing countermeasures such as differential privacy for training data and robust authentication for access control. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive analysis of evolving regulatory frameworks governing AI tools globally. Based on our comprehensive analysis, we propose targeted recommendations for future research and policy-making to promote responsible and secure adoption of GenAI in the workplace, such as incentivizing the development of explainable AI (XAI) and establishing clear guidelines for ethical data usage. This survey equips stakeholders with a comprehensive understanding of GenAI’s complex workplace landscape, empowering them to harness its benefits responsibly while mitigating risks.

AB  - A policy comprised of a set of rules forms the backbone of Attribute-based Access Control (ABAC) systems. Every incoming request is checked against such a policy and if at least one rule grants the access, it is allowed. Else, access is denied. The initial ABAC policy could be hand crafted by the security administrator or mined from a given set of authorizations using a policy engineering technique. In dynamic ABAC systems, over a period of time, additional authorizations may have to be granted or some removed as per situational changes. These changes are maintained in an auxiliary list. For access resolution, both the policy as well as the auxiliary list are considered before taking a decision. Since such a list can grow indefinitely and checking it adversely affects access resolution efficiency, periodic policy rebuilding must be done by combining the existing policy and the auxiliary list. However, regenerating the ABAC policy requires re-running computationally expensive policy mining algorithms. Further, access mediation has to be put on hold while this step is being carried out, resulting in periods of unavailability of the system. In this paper, we study the intricate problem of balancing access request resolution, accommodating dynamic authorization updates, and ABAC policy rebuilding. We employ a queuing theoretic approach where the access mediation process is modeled as an M/G/1 queue with vacation or limited service. While the server is primarily involved in resolving access requests, it occasionally goes on vacation to rebuild the ABAC policy. We study the effect of queue discipline on several performance parameters like request arrival rate, access resolution time, vacation duration and interval between vacations. Results of an extensive set of experiments provide a direction toward efficient implementation of dynamic ABAC systems.

AB  - Cloud computing has become the most needed technology for the IT industry. Impersonation attacks are among the most dangerous threats that Clouds face. In this paper, we present an approach to detect masquerade attacks in Clouds. The efficient detection of these attacks should correlate user behaviors in distinct environments and also should apply to several deployment models. We present and evaluate three approaches to detect Impersonation and masquerade attacks. The first approach analyzes sequences of correlated system calls from the VMs operating systems, while the second analyzes the NetFlow data from the network environment. The third approach integrates these two approaches by using a neural network that will produce better detections than any of the first two approaches. To simplify the testing and the evaluation of the three methods, the Cloud Intrusion Detection Dataset (CIDD) is used as a source for cloud audits data. The evaluation has considered alternative deployment models through our two intrusion detection frameworks, CIDS and CIDS-VIRT. The paper also shows that the proposed detection approaches are more accurate and outperform the SWAD-MMD, a recent masquerade detection framework that works in the cloud computing systems. Furthermore, the paper details our experimental results and evaluates the computational performance and the detection accuracy of these approaches.

KW  - Countermeasures
AB  - With the increase in cyberattacks, developing appropriate strategies to mitigate and prevent them is essential. In the literature, tools exist that either help prevent or mitigate them. Attack graphs help define mitigation strategies because they help represent and visualize the attacker’s position on a system. However, the mitigation actions are not instantiated on the attack graph. This paper proposes an approach to generate an automated attack-defense graph based on real-time monitored system alerts and an extensive and comprehensive state-of-the-art review. We propose to enrich logical attack graphs generated by a logical reasoner. The enrichment process is possible thanks to a vulnerability ontology that infers additional impacts for an exploited vulnerability. We propose a countermeasure selection approach based on graph matching to generate an optimal Incident Response (IR) playbook. We propose instantiating the generated playbook’s IR actions to get an attack-defense graph in real-time. This instantiation is done thanks to anti-correlation. The anti-correlation ensures that the countermeasures are instantiated on the appropriate attack graph nodes. Only the IR actions whose execution can be launched automatically are applied. We validate our approach using two use-case scenarios that target critical industrial infrastructures. We analyze the countermeasures instantiated on the attack graphs for the scenarios that can achieve the attack goal. We evaluated the approach concerning the security relevance of instantiated countermeasures in attack graphs for several attack paths. The countermeasures instantiated on a node are always relevant to the attacker’s action represented by this node. We also evaluate the approach regarding time performance, considering several situations for the use-case scenarios. The generation time depends on the number of vulnerabilities involved in the scenario. The generation time is on average 0.161 s when the playbook has been generated before the attack defense graph generation process.

AB  - One of the important premises of unattended operation, a highly promoted characteristic of fission batteries and advanced microreactors, is the ability to automate the analysis of sensors data used in support of operational monitoring and control. To meet this vision, this work proposes a new monitoring and data recovery paradigm to ensure resilience against data corruption which may be the result of malicious intrusion into the reactor operational network. This is paramount to ensure 100% availability under contingency scenarios such as cyberattacks. In support of this vision, earlier work has presented the concept of covert cognizance and demonstrated its mathematical ability to identify and embed cognizance parameters under the noise-dominated null space of the sensors data. This work extends this concept and applies it in real-time to demonstrate three key characteristics: zero-impact, zero-observability, and data recovery, where the first characteristic is to ensure no impact on operation, the second is immunity to discovery by pattern recognition techniques, and the third is to allow recovery of corrupt or falsified data. Recognizing that fission batteries are designed to operate under steady state most of the time, we elect to employ a small modular reactor model under transient operational conditions to demonstrate the operational resilience enabled by the covert cognizance paradigm. Specifically, the PI controller is augmented with the covert cognizance modules to develop self-awareness and enable automatic data recovery. The developed modules are expected to be equally applicable to a wide range of advanced reactor technologies relying on full or partial unattended control.

AB  - Ensuring data integrity is crucial for IoT-based healthcare and emotion care services, which utilize Fog computing to bring resources and services closer to the network edge. This proximity, however, increases the risks of data tampering, loss, and unauthorized access. To mitigate these risks, Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) platforms such as Hash graph, Big chain-DB, IOTA (Internet of Things Application) and Blockchain are being investigated for their potential to enhance data integrity within Fog computing environments. This study presents a framework designed to ensure data integrity in IoT-based healthcare and emotion care services by leveraging IOTA technology. IOTA, which employs a directed a-cyclic graph (DAG) structure known as the Tangle, provides a secure, decentralized and tamper-resistant method for data storage and sharing. Unlike traditional blockchain, IOTA’s consensus mechanism operates without miners, offering improved scalability and efficiency suitable for IoT environments. Our proposed framework exploits IOTA’s capabilities to deliver a robust solution for maintaining data integrity in Fog computing contexts. The evaluation results demonstrate the framework’s feasibility and effectiveness in enhancing data integrity for IoT-based healthcare and emotion care services. Although IOTA significantly improves data integrity by complicating unauthorized data alterations, it is essential to acknowledge that complete immutability is influenced by various factors, such as consensus mechanisms and the number of network participants, similar to the limitations observed in other DLTs.

MV-Honeypot, or Metaverse-Honeypot, as a commercial off-the-shelf solution that can counter these cyber attack-causing vulnerabilities, should be developed. To fill this gap, we study user’s engagements with Avatars in Metaverse, analyze possible security vulnerabilities, and create a model named Simplified Avatar Relationship Association with Non-linear Gradient (SARANG) that draws the full diagram of infrastructure components and data flow through accessing Metaverse in this paper. We also determine the most significant threat for each component’s cyberattacks that will affect user data and Avatars. As a result, the commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) of the MV-Honeypot must be established.

AB  - The need for secure and effective communication in vehicular networks is fundamental to the successful development of connected and autonomous vehicles. In this research, we propose a decentralized blockchain-based architecture for vehicular authentication and message exchange, using smart contracts to increase trust, and security. The process of authentication and the transferring of data has been intentionally segregated into blockchains and designed with regard to two types of velocities that have the ability to impact them, tailored to their specific functions and operational dynamics. The authentication blockchain uses a lightweight consensus mechanism specific to quickly verify the identity of entities, helping to form mutual trust. In contrast, the communication blockchain uses a heavier consensus mechanism to ensure integrity and traceability of the messages within the network. This means that there are two different types of consensus mechanisms on each of the blockchains; one which has a low concern for security to authenticate the ‘fact of identity’, and the second, which securely (i.e. conspirators accountability) maintain integrity and assurance for the contents of the messages shared on the second blockchain. The segregation of functionality thus had the effect of improving the performance and scalability of the entire network, and posing an additional layer of security, minimizing the attack surface, and reducing the complexity of consensus per blockchain. The smart contract form of the dual blockchain architecture successfully gives a secure, efficient, and scalable means of managing vehicle communication in decentralized intelligent transportation systems.

AB  - Recent security reports point to an alarming increase in the number and frequency of data breach attacks against organizations worldwide. With the rise of data breaches, how quickly a firm detects a breach determines the extent of the incident impact on the business and its customers.  Although prior studies have focused on several important factors that deal with the functions of detection, prevention and prediction of breach incidents, these studies have overlooked the time factor of breach detection. This research seeks to fulfill the lack of research and attempts to explore the factors that affect detection time of data breaches. Using survival analysis, we examine 696 publicly reported breaches between 2010 and 2017 and measure the impact of threat actors, attack types, affected confidentiality data, affected assets, and industries on breach detection time. Findings show that the time to detect data breaches caused by privilege misuse is 2.5 times slower, followed by 1.4 times for breaches that target servers. On the other hand, data breaches that involve payment card skimmers are 79% faster to detect.  To gain further insight into these factors that slow down detection time, we perform subgroup analyses. Findings show that data breaches involving privilege misuse through LAN access are 2.2 times slower to detect. Furthermore, data breaches targeting servers are 5.7 times slower to detect in the accommodation industry, followed by 2.8 times in the administrative industry, and 2.4 times in the healthcare industry.

AB  - The rapid growth in the number of devices and their connectivity has enlarged the attack surface and made cyber systems more vulnerable. As attackers become increasingly sophisticated and resourceful, mere reliance on traditional cyber protection, such as intrusion detection, firewalls, and encryption, is insufficient to secure the cyber systems. Cyber resilience provides a new security paradigm that complements inadequate protection with resilience mechanisms. A Cyber-Resilient Mechanism (CRM) adapts to the known or zero-day threats and uncertainties in real-time and strategically responds to them to maintain the critical functions of the cyber systems in the event of successful attacks. Feedback architectures play a pivotal role in enabling the online sensing, reasoning, and actuation process of the CRM. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is an important gathering of algorithms that epitomize the feedback architectures for cyber resilience. It allows the CRM to provide dynamic and sequential responses to attacks with limited or without prior knowledge of the environment and the attacker. In this work, we review the literature on RL for cyber resilience and discuss the cyber-resilient defenses against three major types of vulnerabilities, i.e., posture-related, information-related, and human-related vulnerabilities. We introduce moving target defense, defensive cyber deception, and assistive human security technologies as three application domains of CRMs to elaborate on their designs. The RL algorithms also have vulnerabilities themselves. We explain the major vulnerabilities of RL and present develop several attack models where the attacker target the information exchanged between the environment and the agent: the rewards, the state observations, and the action commands. We show that the attacker can trick the RL agent into learning a nefarious policy with minimum attacking effort. The paper introduces several defense methods to secure the RL-enabled systems from these attacks. However, there is still a lack of works that focuses on the defensive mechanisms for RL-enabled systems. Last but not least, we discuss the future challenges of RL for cyber security and resilience and emerging applications of RL-based CRMs.

AB  - Despite the robust structure of the Internet, it is still susceptible to disruptive routing updates that prevent network traffic from reaching its destination. Our research shows that BGP announcements that are associated with disruptive updates tend to occur in groups of relatively high frequency, followed by periods of infrequent activity. We hypothesize that we may use these bursty characteristics to detect anomalous routing incidents. In this work, we use manually verified ground truth metadata and volume of announcements as a baseline measure, and propose a burstiness measure that detects prior anomalous incidents with high recall and better precision than the volume baseline. We quantify the burstiness of inter-arrival times around the date and times of four large-scale incidents: the Indosat hijacking event in April 2014, the Telecom Malaysia leak in June 2015, the Bharti Airtel Ltd. hijack in November 2015, and the MainOne leak in November 2018; and three smaller scale incidents that led to traffic interception: the Belarusian traffic direction in February 2013, the Icelandic traffic direction in July 2013, and the Russian telecom that hijacked financial services in April 2017. Our method leverages the burstiness of disruptive update messages to detect these incidents. We describe limitations, open challenges, and how this method can be used for routing anomaly detection.

AB  - Cybersecurity readiness is critical for safeguarding National Critical Information Infrastructure (NCII) against rapidly evolving threats. This study applies Dynamic Capabilities (DC) theory to examine how Malaysian NCII agencies develop adaptive capabilities to counter such threats. Using a qualitative design, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 16 representatives from 15 organizations spanning finance, telecommunications, transportation, and government. Thematic analysis was employed to interpret readiness factors through the DC dimensions of sensing, seizing, and transforming. Findings reveal that sensing capabilities - such as situational awareness, policy flexibility, and technological agility - enable proactive threat detection and adaptation. Seizing capabilities emphasize dynamic leadership, strategic resource allocation, and proactive risk management as critical for addressing vulnerabilities and reinforcing resilience. Transforming capabilities, including crisis resilience planning, continuous learning, and a security-embedded organizational culture, underscore the need for ongoing adaptation and collaboration to sustain long-term cybersecurity readiness. The study reconceptualizes cybersecurity readiness as a dynamic, capability-driven process rather than a static checklist. The findings show that cybersecurity is not a one-time compliance exercise but an ongoing, evolving process requiring continuous sensing, seizing, and transforming. Leaders must prioritize adaptive governance structures that encourage strategic agility, flexible policy responses, and proactive risk management. The proposed DC-based framework offers practical guidance for high-risk organizations emphasizing leadership commitment, a security-oriented culture, and resource alignment. Although grounded in Malaysia’s NCII context, the framework has broader applicability for critical infrastructure globally.

AB  - The integration of smart city applications with healthcare has revolutionized patient monitoring and medical data management. However, ensuring the privacy and security of Electronic Health Records (EHR) remains a critical challenge, especially in IoT-based environments with resource-constrained devices. This paper proposes a novel Blockchain-Enabled Federated Learning (BFL) framework to enhance privacy preservation in EHR processing. The proposed framework leverages zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP) for authentication and homomorphic encryption for secure computation, ensuring robust data security without exposing raw patient data. Federated Learning (FL) enables decentralized model training across IoT devices, reducing privacy risks while maintaining data utility. Additionally, blockchain technology enhances the integrity and transparency of EHR transactions by creating a tamper-proof ledger. The performance of the proposed BFL framework is evaluated based on data utility, model accuracy, execution time, and scalability across varying sizes of EHR datasets. Results demonstrate improved privacy preservation, reduced computational overhead, and enhanced model efficiency, making it a promising approach for secure and privacy-aware IoT-based smart healthcare systems.

AB  - Digital transformation leads to the inevitable change in the security paradigm for machines on a factory production floor. A unified namespace for machines in an Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) network is only reliable when machine assets can trust and verify the identity of assets connected to the IIoT system. Current methods of asset authentication do not consider physical unclonable functions (PUFs) and can easily be spoofed or misused. Our work proposes using PUFs for industrial equipment such as CNC machines, robots, and 3D printers for identifying machines on a network and providing authentication procedures. In this work, we chose to use the vibration associated with machines and its embedded moving parts as a means to identify machine assets on a network. It is hypothesized that the vibrations associated with specific machine movements will be unique to each machine even when machines look exactly the same. The moving parts within a machine may produce a unique vibration pattern that can be used for machine identification throughout the working cycle. Our method requires light computing and relatively cheap measuring devices to capture the ‘fingerprints’ of machines and verify the signal's integrity. An adequate number of equipment has been tested for the worst-case scenario, i.e. when two machines look exactly the same with the same moving parts and produce exactly similar motion to generate the vibration signal. Data preprocessing and standard machine learning techniques like RF, LASSO, and SVM show great performance on raw time series data, enabling 100% TPR and more than 94% TNR in detecting the false class of the machines.

AB  - As a transversal concept tied to human evolution, security has increased its relevance at the same pace as development and digitisation. With the advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) and the sophistication of advanced persistent threats, the emerging paradigm of cognitive security (i.e., defined by some authors as the use of self-aware and adaptable AI with learning capabilities to detect and mitigate security threats) gains momentum. Nevertheless, cognitive security is a complex concept that requires a more granular description. In this article, we redefine cognitive security by first analysing the state of the art to derive the current state of practice and the definitions of cognitive security. Next, we expand the concept of cognitive security by analysing its multiple pillars, including learning theories, AI technologies, human–computer interactions, and the ethical and legal aspects impacting its development and implementation. The latter is crucial towards understanding cognitive security, providing insight into its potential and prerequisites towards its realisation while emphasising its multidisciplinary nature. In addition to such a description, we analyse the current challenges in three closely interconnected fields, namely cybersecurity, digital forensics, and digital investigations, to provide a taxonomy that can be used to assess the current challenges and limitations of cognitive security and understand its potential better. Finally, we propose future research directions, aiming to develop cognitive systems capable of continuous learning, adaptation, and ethical compliance in dynamic cybersecurity environments. Our findings highlight the role of cognitive computing systems in enhancing cybersecurity, discussing the integration of human cognition and AI for proactive and resilient security solutions.

AB  - Solid State Drives (SSDs) have gained significant market share among data storage options in recent years due to increased speed and durability. But when compared to Hard Disk Drives (HDDs), SSDs contain additional complexity which must be managed in firmware. Some manufacturers make firmware updates available, but their proprietary protections leave end users unable to verify the authenticity of the firmware post installation. This means that attackers who are able to get a malicious firmware version installed on a victim SSD are able to operate with impunity, as the owner will have no tools for detection. We use a method for performing side channel analysis of the current drawn by an SSD to compare its behavior while running genuine firmware against its behavior when running modified firmware. We further test this method for robustness against changes in external factors such as temperature and supplied power. In each case, we train a binary classifier with samples of genuine as well as modified firmware activity and are able to discriminate between them with over 90% accuracy in most experiments. Solid State Drives are trusted to store and protect critical data, so verification of SSD firmware is an important step towards having trust and confidence in the growing landscape of embedded devices used for critical operations.

AB  - Predictive analysis allows next-generation cyber defense that is more proactive than current approaches based on intrusion detection. In this paper, we discuss various aspects of predictive methods in cyber defense and illustrate them on three examples of recent approaches. The first approach uses data mining to extract frequent attack scenarios and uses them to project ongoing cyberattacks. The second approach uses a dynamic network entity reputation score to predict malicious actors. The third approach uses time series analysis to forecast attack rates in the network. This paper presents a unique evaluation of the three distinct methods in a common environment of an intrusion detection alert sharing platform, which allows for a comparison of the approaches and illustrates the capabilities of predictive analysis for current and future research and cybersecurity operations. Our experiments show that all three methods achieved a sufficient technology readiness level for experimental deployment in an operational setting with promising accuracy and usability. Namely prediction and projection methods, despite their differences, are highly usable for predictive blacklisting, the first provides a more detailed output, and the second is more extensible. Network security situation forecasting is lightweight and displays very high accuracy, but does not provide details on predicted events.

AB  - Industry 5.0 is an emerging phase in the industrial field where humans and the latest technologies work together to bring revolutionary changes to work processes. It is the future of the upcoming generation for smart city development. Operations and designing of smart systems for Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) devices include various types of decision-making at different levels of domains. Highly complex systems have a huge number of variables and decision-making requirements which also needs real-time data gathering from IIoT devices. Fog computing performs a key role by locating IIoT devices close to its proximity and reducing the processing time in comparison to cloud computing for smart systems. It makes smart systems work in a secure, flexible and time-sensitive manner. The presence of sensors makes data-intensive analysis challenging in these systems but fog computing handles it all. Along with other challenges, security is also one of the concerns that can affect the overall system if compromised. The main objective of this article is to introduce hierarchical fog computing-based architecture for smart energy-supplying systems as a part of Industry 5.0. This architecture will be able to support a large number of infrastructural components and provide services efficiently. In this article, validation of the amount of data transmitted by IIoT devices to the cloud per second is done for three different cases: 1. The proposed four-layer fog computing architecture, 2. Fog architecture with only layer three layers with the rest of the computing on the cloud, 3. A traditional system with cloud computing. The proposed approach is validated over state of art approaches in terms of accuracy. Moreover, the security of the architecture is provided using the Attribute-based encryption (ABE) scheme, which ensures data confidentiality with minimum overhead.

Existing hierarchical key management schemes, such as the RB method, provide partial protection but remain vulnerable to impersonation, replay, and node capture attacks. To address these challenges, we propose IHKEM (Improved Hierarchical Key Establishment and Management), a lightweight yet robust protocol that integrates symmetric and asymmetric primitives for mutual authentication, dynamic session key establishment, and end-to-end confidentiality. Unlike static key distribution methods, IHKEM eliminates unilateral key control, employs nonce- and timestamp-based validation for replay resistance, and supports adaptive key refreshing to preserve forward and backward secrecy. Extensive NS-2.35 simulations demonstrate that IHKEM significantly reduces energy consumption (∼15–20% over RB), improves flexibility against node compromise (>80% uncompromised links under 15% capture), extends network lifetime (delayed FND/HND thresholds), lowers memory footprint (∼20–25% reduction), while incurring only ∼3% higher overhead compared to lightweight schemes such as SEE2PK. Beyond its immediate gains, IHKEM’s modular architecture ensures post-quantum readiness, enabling seamless integration of lattice-based key encapsulation and signature schemes. This work bridges the gap between efficiency, resilience, and long-term cryptographic sustainability in WSNs.

AB  - The growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm has resulted in a proliferation of connected devices and their applications. Autonomous IoT (AIoT) refers to a network of interconnected devices that operate without human intervention, making decisions and performing tasks autonomously. Traditional methods of provisioning IoT devices, such as manual configuration and over-the-air updates, are error-prone and insecure. The emergence of eSIMs (embedded SIMs) provides a viable solution for secure and flexible identity management in IoT devices. This work implements a low-cost, zero-touch remote provisioning system using GSMA standard Over-The-Air (OTA) IoT-SAFE protocol. This research predicts that future IoT devices will be eSIM-enabled, which are simple to configure, provision, validate profiles, and check security policies remotely. IoT onboarding processes are designed where blockchains are used to verify immutable repositories to store this network manifests, verifiable by Ethereum smart contracts. The integrated framework combines blockchain contracts, eSIM-based remote SIM provisioning through IoT-SAFE protocol, and SDN to manage IoT ecosystems' security. The proposed solution is evaluated using simulations and security analysis, and it demonstrates its feasibility at scale and resilience to attacks even under insecure environments. When compared with the baseline IEEE 802.15.4 protocol, our SDN-based Remote-SIM provisioning system (SIeSIM) reduces overhead to about 240 ms Time-To-Provision (TTP), outperforming manual provisioning by nearly 320 % and 210 % compared to expert provisioning in terms of TTP performances, respectively.

AB  - Supply Chain Risk Management (SCRM) is a rapidly growing field of research encompassing identification, assessment, mitigation, and monitoring of the risks or unexpected and unprecedented events. Among the researchers, there has been a significant focus on identifying, mitigating, and managing the risks that affect the supply chain (SC). Though the research on SCRM remains for an extended period, still the industries are facing difficulties in managing the SC risks. Also, the SC managers have begun to focus on decision-making based on numerous data sources for predicting the uncertainties more accurately to achieve a proactive and predictive intelligent risk management mechanism. These attributes make Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine learning (ML) suitable techniques in the SCRM field. The application of these techniques in SCRM is in a nascent stage. In this view, this paper presents a systematic and descriptive review of the literature and identifies the various AI and ML methods applied in different phases related to SCRM. Also, it investigates the different categories of SC risks and the existing articles based on the AI technique used. This analysis focuses on research articles related to SCRM from three scientific databases published between 2010 and 2021 for detailed study. Finally, this review provides unexplored and missing aspects in current research, challenges on implementing AI technologies, and describes promising avenues for the future.

KW  - Maritime cyber security
KW  - Cross-border paperless trade
KW  - Cyber security model
AB  - Cross-border paperless trade is the digital exchange of trade-related information and documents between countries, eliminating the need for physical paper, thereby streamlining and speeding up international trade processes. Adopting paperless systems in cross-border trade offers numerous benefits, including increased efficiency, cost savings, and faster processing times for private companies or public bodies, including governments, suppliers, logistics providers, customs, regulatory agencies, sellers and buyers. However, this transition also introduces a range of cybersecurity challenges. This paper investigates the cyber security threats and security models pertinent to paperless cross-border trade systems. In this study, the types of cyber threats and current security measures are explored, and an enhanced cyber security model for paperless cross-border maritime trade systems is proposed based on ISO/IEC 27,001 Information Security Management System and NIST SP 800–53 Security and Privacy Controls for Information Systems and Organizations to mitigate potential cyber risks. It is concluded that to adopt effective cybersecurity strategies, identifying assets in cross-border paperless trade systems is required. Assets encompass data, infrastructure, applications, and personnel in these systems. For the robust cyber security model in the cross-border paperless trade systems, traditional security measures, such as firewalls, encryption, or multi-factor authentication, are required to be integrated with emerging security technologies, such as zero trust architecture, artificial intelligence, or blockchain technologies and security framework including layered security approach, real-time threat detection and response, secure data exchange protocols, policy development, stakeholder collaboration and training and awareness programs.

AB  - Alongside advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI), significant progress has been made in big data processing, edge/cloud computing, and ubiquitous computing in the past two decades. These advancements catalyzed the development and adoption of Digital Twins (DT) across various domains, serving as virtual replicas of Physical Objects (POs). DTs provide advanced visualization and simulation capabilities, enabling effective estimation, optimization, and forecasting of PO's behaviors. However, the widespread adoption of DTs has introduced various security threats, vulnerabilities, and attacks. Despite ongoing research in DT applications and security, there is a lack of systematic review of the DT security literature across domains and architectural layers. This study fills this gap by systematically reviewing DT research, focusing on three interrelated aspects: DT applications, architectural layers, and security. We explore DT's architectural layers, functional requirements, application, and creation software to identify potential threats, attacks, and vulnerabilities specific to DT layers and application domains. We then systematize our findings under a unified security framework and pinpoint countermeasures against identified security challenges. Furthermore, our study explores DT's role in mitigating existing cyber threats, and we conclude our work by identifying open challenges and potential research directions.

AB  - This paper introduces the Integrated Security Embedded Resilience Architecture (ISERA) as an advanced resilience mechanism for Industrial Control Systems (ICS) and Operational Technology (OT) environments. The ISERA framework integrates security by design principles, micro-segmentation, and Island Mode Operation (IMO) to enhance cyber resilience and ensure continuous, secure operations. The methodology deploys a Forward-Thinking Architecture Strategy (FTAS) algorithm, which utilises an industrial Intrusion Detection System (IDS) implemented with Python’s Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) library. The FTAS algorithm successfully identified and responded to cyber-attacks, ensuring minimal system disruption. ISERA has been validated through comprehensive testing scenarios simulating Denial of Service (DoS) attacks and malware intrusions, at both the IT and OT layers where it successfully mitigates the impact of malicious activity. Results demonstrate ISERA’s efficacy in real-time threat detection, containment, and incident response, thus ensuring the integrity and reliability of critical infrastructure systems. ISERA’s decentralised approach contributes to global net zero goals by optimising resource use and minimising environmental impact. By adopting a decentralised control architecture and leveraging virtualisation, ISERA significantly enhances the cyber resilience and sustainability of critical infrastructure systems. This approach not only strengthens defences against evolving cyber threats but also optimises resource allocation, reducing the system’s carbon footprint. As a result, ISERA ensures the uninterrupted operation of essential services while contributing to broader net zero goals.

AB  - Recent advancements in Internet of Things (IoT) and edge computing have led to rapid growth in the number of IoT devices generating extensive volumes of data at the network edge. Efficiently scheduling tasks on these devices, particularly under strict latency constraints in federated learning (FL) environments, poses substantial challenges. In this paper, we propose a novel trust-energy-aware scheduling framework specifically designed for latency-constrained federated edge computing scenarios. Our innovative strategy integrates Dynamic Deep Q-Network (Dynamic-DQN) reinforcement learning with Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME), enabling dynamic, real-time assessment of device trustworthiness with interpretability and transparency. This combined approach allows the framework to intelligently allocate tasks to IoT devices, explicitly optimizing for reduced latency, improved energy efficiency, and enhanced system reliability. Extensive experimental evaluations confirm that our proposed method substantially outperforms conventional reinforcement learning and heuristic scheduling algorithms, demonstrating significant reductions in latency, superior energy management, and improved scalability. These results underscore the robustness and practical effectiveness of our framework in addressing critical FL challenges.

AB  - Advanced and persistent multi-staged intrusion attacks are usually conducted by elite well-resourced cyber threat actors with the goal of bypassing the defense-in-depth and zoning policies of enterprise networks and accessing critical internal assets which are embedded deep in the target network (Hutchins, Cloppert, Amin, et al., 2011, Wilkens, Ortmann, Haas, Vallentin, Fischer). Starting from an externally reachable host, these attacks compromise a chain of network hosts until they reach their targets. Each compromised host could provide attackers access to new systems and network zones, thus enabling them to intrude deeper into the network. While conventional detection-based mechanisms are necessary to defeat such attacks, they are not enough as they can be evaded by stealthy or zero-day attack techniques. To complement these conventional approaches, in our previous works (Jafarian et al., 2015b; 2016; 2014a), we have proposed several proactive defense techniques based on the paradigms of cyber agility and cyber deception to defeat various types of cyber intrusions through disrupting their reconnaissance. While each of these techniques can individually defeat a specific type of reconnaissance, none is individually enough to defeat different types of reconnaissance on which multi-staged intrusions rely. In this paper, we first show that defeating multi-staged intrusion attacks requires a synergistic fusion of a group of coordinated strategies for (1) disrupting both external and internal reconnaissance, (2) defeating both active (e.g., port-scanning) and passive (e.g., sniffing) reconnaissance, as well as (3) disrupting collaborative reconnaissance and information reuse as attackers laterally move inside the internal network. Then, building on our previous approaches, we present a novel proactive technique, called MultiRHM, that anonymizes different identifying attributes of network hosts (IP address, MAC address, domain name responses to rDNS queries, and fingerprints) over different dimensions (time and space) to obfuscate identities of network hosts against all aforementioned types of reconnaissance. We present the necessary architectures, protocols, and algorithms for the deployment of MultiRHM in an enterprise network. Through both theoretical analysis and simulation, we show that MultiRHM is highly effective in defeating multi-staged intrusion attacks.

AB  - The Industrial Internet of Medical Things (IIoMT) transforms healthcare through interconnected devices enabling real-time monitoring, diagnostics, and treatment. However, these devices often lack robust physical security, making them vulnerable to tampering, theft, and unauthorized access. This paper introduces SecureGuard-IIoMT, an innovative adaptive physical security framework designed to mitigate such vulnerabilities across diverse deployment environments. SecureGuard-IIoMT comprises three integrated components enhancing device security. The first, Adaptive Sensor-Based Intrusion Detection (ASID), utilizes vibration, proximity, and pressure sensors combined with lightweight machine learning models to detect unauthorized physical interactions in real-time. ASID maintains detection accuracy across varied conditions by dynamically adjusting its thresholds. The second component, Dynamic Tamper Evident Enclosure (DTE), is a self-healing smart enclosure equipped with a tamper detection circuit. Upon tampering detection, DTE triggers alerts, initiates self-healing to ensure continuous device operation, and logs detailed incident reports for further analysis. The third component, Blockchain-Powered Access Control System (BPACS), leverages blockchain technology to maintain decentralized, secure, and immutable access logs. Only authorized physical access requests are approved and recorded, preventing unauthorized interactions. Extensive simulations and real-world tests demonstrate that SecureGuard-IIoMT achieves an 85 % reduction in tampering risks and a 92 % decrease in unauthorized access attempts. Its lightweight, modular design ensures compatibility with various IIoMT devices without compromising performance or cost-effectiveness. SecureGuard-IIoMT effectively bridges critical security gaps in IIoMT device hardening, providing scalable solutions essential for securing healthcare infrastructures. Future work will focus on integrating quantum-resistant encryption into BPACS and employing advanced tamper-evident materials for enhanced security. Future work will focus on integrating quantum-resistant encryption into BPACS and employing advanced tamper-evident materials for enhanced security. The key contributions of this study include the design of an adaptive multi-sensor intrusion detection module (ASID), a tamper-evident self-healing enclosure (DTE), and a decentralized blockchain-based access control system (BPACS). Collectively, these components achieve an 85 % reduction in tampering risks and a 92 % decrease in unauthorized access attempts while maintaining lightweight and scalable deployment.

AB  - The different types of cyber-attacks on information and telecommunications systems are becoming increasingly sophisticated and complex, with several defined phases (attack pattern). Therefore, it is necessary to research and develop new infrastructures to understand and detect them. This work addresses the design and implementation of a system capable of detecting, analyzing, modeling and visualizing attack patterns in real time to build a dataset with labeled events attacks. The system consists of the three subsystems, detection of attack events subsystem; attack events analysis subsystem to model active patterns based on Common Attack Pattern Enumeration and Classification (CAPEC) definitions; and the attack pattern visualization subsystem. The results obtained from the attacks carried out over a period of six months under a series of assumptions are shown. These results have allowed the construction of a dataset with attack events labelled according to the possible attack patterns to which they belong. The developed system can provide an organization with a very real situational awareness of the cybersecurity situation.

These systems commonly use protocols like Modbus/RTU, Modbus TCP/IP, DNP3, and IEC60870, each chosen to meet specific operational requirements. However, vulnerabilities in protocols like Modbus TCP/IP, especially in access control, authentication, and data integrity leave SCADA networks susceptible to cyber threats, with risks ranging from process disruption to data breaches or potential physical harm to infrastructure. This study proposes a simulation-based security framework for SCADA environments using the Modbus TCP/IP protocol, incorporating authentication through unique identification bytes, robust encryption to secure communications, and a layered Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (IDS/IPS) to detect and counteract malicious activities. The framework’s effectiveness is demonstrated through simulated scenarios and a real-world case study, showcasing significant resilience against common cyber threats faced by SCADA systems.

To combat such threats, a novel approach utilizing generative adversarial networks (GANs) is introduced to identify attacks on smart metering systems within microgrids. However, the GANs alone cannot make informed decisions, necessitating a decision-making framework. To address this requirement, a novel method based on prediction intervals is proposed to establish decision boundaries, determining the legitimacy of received data. To evaluate the proposed methodology's performance and accuracy, real-world data from a wind farm is employed. Results demonstrate the method's effectiveness and high accuracy in detecting false data injection attacks. Additionally, the study simulates a false data injection attack on a test microgrid to assess its resilience against CAs, revealing that a successful attack can significantly disrupt normal system operations. This research contributes to enhancing urban microgrid energy security by considering policy-informed decision-making, navigating complexity, and surmounting deployment barriers considering policy and government intervention.

AB  - Ransomware has become one of the most notorious types of malware, increasingly targeting end-users, governments, and businesses. Its growing sophistication poses a significant cybersecurity threat. Researchers have proposed numerous defense solutions to mitigate the ransomware threat. They have also conducted over 10 review studies to cover certain aspects of ransomware in the past ten years. However, none of them detail the attack mechanisms or explore possible mitigation strategies. To this end, we present a comprehensive review of ransomware and its defenses. We detail the attack mechanisms and vulnerabilities exploited by ransomware, and assess both commercial and academic defense solutions. Additionally, we explore active defense concepts that help mitigate ransomware threats and provide strategic guidance for future ransomware defense efforts. Our survey serves as an entry point into the study of ransomware and its defense, offering potential insights for enhancing existing solutions and minimizing the impact of ransomware attacks.

AB  - Online Social Networks (OSNs), together with messaging services are tools for the exchange of entertainment-related information. However, they represent virtual environments capable of providing relevant information related to emergency or criminal events. Thanks to the simple way of using OSNs in combination to modern ubiquitous Internet of Things (IoT) smart devices, the generation and exploitation of such information is made available to users in real-time even more easily. Unfortunately, its reuse has not been taken into consideration yet due to the lack of specific models and related software tools. In this context, the paper presents a social media-based over layer for supporting the monitoring, detection, computation and information sharing of social media information related to emergency scenarios centered on smartphones and text mining techniques. The proposal is assessed through two different case studies, by evaluating the performances of different classifiers and by showing the logic of the functionalities of the related apps.

AB  - Anomalous authentications are a critical indicator of advanced persistent threats (APTs), in which adversaries exploit network vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access and move stealthily between devices using stolen credentials. As the set of interactions between entities in a network essentially forms graph-structured data, state-of-the-art algorithms such as graph neural networks (GNNs) can be used to detect anomalous interactions that may indicate an ongoing attack. However, the success of detecting anomalous authentications using GNNs is conditioned on the representational power and performance of those models. A crucial problem is how to aggregate the node embeddings so that the GNN can better represent the network topology. Existing graph neural networks traditionally use simple functions (e.g., sum, max, mean) on the node embeddings to preserve permutation invariance and achieve consistent node representations. However, we argue that an effective aggregation of node features into a graph-level representation cannot be achieved through simple sum or mean operations. In this work, we propose a residual soft-attention scheme that facilitates the aggregation of node representations through a weighted sum, resulting in enhanced node representations and improved filtration of irrelevant information. Experimental results on three relevant datasets have shown the proposed method can detect abnormal authentications with lower false positives than competitors.

AB  - Connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) have gained significant importance in intelligent transportation systems. However, CAVs are associated with significant cyber-risks caused by different threat-agents, which require robust mitigation strategies for secure operation. Different categories of threat-agents come with varying resources, motivation, and skills that must be addressed effectively for the secure operation of CAVs. This study offers a comprehensive analysis of cybersecurity risks from different categories of threat-agents targeting CAVs. A novel hybrid multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) technique has been developed to prioritize the threat-agent categories as part of the cyber defense mechanism. In this study, the major threat-agent categories are identified from the existing literature and cybersecurity reports. Then expert opinion is collected on the likelihood and severity of cyber-attacks undertaken by different threat-agent categories. Single-valued neutrosophic fuzzy sets (SVNFS) are implemented to consolidate the subjectivity of the linguistic opinions given by the experts. Then Best-Worst Method (BWM) is used to determine the relative criteria weightage on the cyber-attack consequences. These weights are then supplied to the ViseKriterijum-ska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenj (VIKOR) method for ranking the categories of threat-agents based on the risk perceived by the experts. A case study is presented with five categories of threat-agents and five loss criteria targeting CAVs to validate the viability of the proposed model. The result shows that insider attackers pose maximum risk for cybersecurity of CAVs. The proposed technique will provide helpful insights to the decision-makers for formulating effective defense strategies against cyber-attackers.

AB  - This work introduces a decision support framework, called Cyber Risk Optimiser for Smart homeS (CROSS), which advises both smart home users and smart home service providers on how to select an optimal portfolio of cyber security controls to counteract cyber attacks in a smart home including traditional cyber attacks and adversarial machine learning attacks. CROSS is based on a multi-objective bi-level two-stage optimisation. In stage-one optimisation, the problem is modelled as a multi-leader-follower game that considers both security and economic objectives, where the provider selects a security portfolio to protect both itself and its users, while rational attackers target the weakest path. Stage-two optimisation is a Stackelberg security game that focuses on additional user security controls under the remit of smart home users. While CROSS can potentially be applied to other similar use cases, in this paper, our aim is to address threats against artificial intelligence (AI) applications as the use of AI in smart Internet of Things (IoT) devices introduces new cyber threats to home environments. Specifically, we have implemented and assessed CROSS in a smart heating use case in a prototypical AI-enabled IoT environment that combines characteristics and vulnerabilities currently present on existing commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) devices, demonstrating the selection of optimal decisions.

AB  - As cybersecurity threats evolve alarmingly, conventional defense strategies are becoming increasingly ineffective. In response to this urgent challenge, our study presents a transformative approach to red-teaming exercises by integrating the MITRE ATT&CK framework. This innovative integration leverages real-world attacker tactics and behaviors to create highly realistic scenarios that rigorously test defenses and uncover previously unidentified vulnerabilities. Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates a significant enhancement in the realism and effectiveness of red-teaming, leading to improved vulnerability identification and the generation of actionable insights for proactive remediation. This study uniquely contributes by providing a structured, data-driven methodology that aligns current defenses with emerging threat tactics and promotes continuous improvement in cybersecurity resilience. Such advancements are essential for organizations seeking to stay ahead of attackers and maintain robust cyber defenses in dynamic threat environments. The significance of this study lies in offering a structured approach to strengthen cybersecurity resilience against evolving threats and providing a model for continual defense enhancement. Future research should investigate the impact of this integration on long-term cybersecurity strategies.

AB  - Even as the reliability of networks has risen, their control mechanisms up in the hierarchy of digital activities have become more vulnerable. Artificial intelligence algorithms are increasingly embedded in infrastructure and economic systems and their resiliency is essential for social and economic stability. This has led to widespread dystopic fears and defensive regulations, ignoring the considerable positives of AI-enhanced activities and institutions. AI resiliency problems include hardware failures, natural calamities, human error, software defects, and external attacks. AI networks of AI networks have emerged with high interdependence and complexity. Operations are often non-transparent ‘black boxes’ operating at lightning speeds, and hard to oversee or fix by humans. Most likely is a control of AI by other AI. This raises the question of human responsibility. The article examines various responses, including technology tools, managerial actions, self-regulation, and a role for government. The latter include rules evolving with technology and applications in a dynamic common law approach for liability, transparency, performance, market structure, interoperation, and more. Needed are principles for a ‘shared intelligence’ of humans with AI, with clear protocols for human overrides of AI. All this raises a new agenda for policymakers, managers, and researchers.

AB  - The handle system that assigns persistent identifiers to the information resources is utilized by the Predictive Maintenance analysis. The persistent identifiers are referred to as the handles that assist as a unique and enduring reference for locating, accessing, and utilizing the resources. Nevertheless, Industrial Internet of Things devices were affected by insider attacks in most of the prevailing works. Thus, an effective Blockchain-enabled secure handle system using Adversarial Stylometry-KAnonymity and Log2 Sigmoid–Gated Recurrent Unit is presented in this paper. It is proposed to enhance the Handle System’s scalability and support real-time data processing. Primarily, the Industrial Internet of Things device and user are registered with the Blockchain. Then, based on Adversarial Stylometry-KAnonymity, the details are privacy preserved. Meanwhile, for the Industrial Internet of Things devices and users, the keys, Quick Response code, and hashcode are generated. Later, the Industrial Internet of Things device setup grounded on Message Authentication Code creation and data sensing is conducted. After that, by using Triangular and S-shaped-fuzzy, a controlled access-based smart contract is created. The Fuzzy system is used to enhance the smart contract by enabling flexible and dynamic decision-making in the context of undefined or inaccurate data. Extensive experiments and analysis proved the effectiveness of the proposed framework for predictive maintenance in Industrial Internet of Things. The outcomes proved that a higher accuracy of 99.12%, Precision of 99.24% and of Recall 99.33% was attained by the proposed model, thereby outperforming similar existing models.

AB  - Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is an emerging architecture that enables a computer network to be intelligently and centrally controlled via software applications. It can help manage the whole network environment in a consistent and holistic way, without the need of understanding the underlying network structure. At present, SDN may face many challenges like insider attacks, i.e., the centralized control plane would be attacked by malicious underlying devices and switches. To protect the security of SDN, effective detection approaches are indispensable. In the literature, challenge-based Collaborative Intrusion Detection Networks (CIDNs) are an effective detection framework in identifying malicious nodes. It calculates the nodes’ reputation and detects a malicious node by sending out a special message called a challenge. In this work, we devise a challenge-based CIDN in SDN and measure its performance against malicious internal nodes. Our results demonstrate that such a mechanism can be effective in SDN environments.
